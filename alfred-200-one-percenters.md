## CRYPTO (1–80)

**[Crypto] #1: Funding Rate Mean Reversion**
Edge: When perpetual funding rates exceed +0.1% per 8h (annualized ~36%), longs are overcrowded. Price reverses within 48h ~65% of the time.
Action: When funding spikes above 0.1%, reduce long exposure or open a small short hedge.

**[Crypto] #2: Weekend Liquidity Trap**
Edge: BTC weekend volume drops 40-60% vs weekdays. Moves that start Friday evening often reverse by Monday open.
Action: Reduce position size by 50% on Friday afternoon. Avoid chasing weekend pumps/dumps.

**[Crypto] #3: CME Gap Fill**
Edge: CME Bitcoin futures gaps (formed over weekends) fill ~77% of the time, usually within 1 week.
Action: When a CME gap forms, place a limit order at the gap level with a wide stop.

**[Crypto] #4: Exchange Outflow Signal**
Edge: When >25,000 BTC leave exchanges in a single week, price appreciates an average of 12% over the following 30 days.
Action: Track net exchange flows via Glassnode/CryptoQuant. Heavy outflows = accumulation. Add to longs.

**[Crypto] #5: Stablecoin Supply Expansion**
Edge: A 5%+ monthly increase in total stablecoin market cap precedes BTC rallies by 2-4 weeks with ~70% accuracy.
Action: Monitor USDT/USDC supply. Rising stablecoin supply = dry powder entering. Get positioned before the move.

**[Crypto] #6: MVRV Z-Score Extremes**
Edge: When MVRV Z-Score drops below 0, BTC is historically undervalued. Every prior instance preceded 100%+ rallies.
Action: Accumulate aggressively when MVRV Z-Score < 0. Begin scaling out above 7.

**[Crypto] #7: Liquidation Cascade Setup**
Edge: When open interest rises 30%+ without a corresponding price move, a liquidation cascade is loading. The squeeze direction hits within 72h ~60% of the time.
Action: Watch OI divergence from price. When OI bloats, prepare for a violent move. Reduce leverage, widen stops.

**[Crypto] #8: Hash Ribbon Buy Signal**
Edge: When the 30-day hash rate MA crosses above the 60-day MA after a miner capitulation, BTC returns average +50% over 6 months.
Action: Buy the hash ribbon crossover. It signals miners have stopped selling and difficulty is adjusting.

**[Crypto] #9: ETH/BTC Ratio as Risk Gauge**
Edge: When ETH/BTC breaks above its 200-day MA, altcoin season follows within 2-4 weeks ~70% of the time.
Action: Use ETH/BTC as your altcoin rotation signal. Rising ratio = risk-on, rotate into high-beta alts.

**[Crypto] #10: Grayscale Premium/Discount**
Edge: GBTC discount narrowing from -40% to -20% preceded the 2023 rally. Premium/discount reflects institutional sentiment.
Action: Track major fund premiums/discounts. Narrowing discount = institutional demand returning.

**[Crypto] #11: Whale Wallet Accumulation**
Edge: Addresses holding 1,000-10,000 BTC increasing their holdings by 3%+ in a month preceded rallies 8 out of 10 times historically.
Action: Monitor whale tier wallets. When they accumulate during fear, follow them.

**[Crypto] #12: NVT Signal Overvaluation**
Edge: When Network Value to Transactions (NVT) signal exceeds 150, BTC is overvalued relative to on-chain activity. Corrections of 20%+ follow ~65% of the time.
Action: Use NVT > 150 as a scale-out trigger. Reduce position by 25-50%.

**[Crypto] #13: Realized Price as Ultimate Support**
Edge: BTC's realized price (average cost basis of all coins) has acted as bear market bottom support in every cycle.
Action: When price approaches realized price, it's a generational buy zone. Size up.

**[Crypto] #14: DeFi TVL Divergence**
Edge: When DeFi TVL rises while token prices stagnate, a repricing higher occurs within 4-8 weeks ~60% of the time.
Action: Track TVL growth independent of price. Real TVL growth (new deposits, not just token appreciation) is bullish.

**[Crypto] #15: Coinbase Premium Index**
Edge: Positive Coinbase premium (BTC price higher on Coinbase vs Binance) signals US institutional buying. Sustained premium > $50 precedes 10%+ moves.
Action: Monitor Coinbase premium. Positive = US buyers driving. Negative = Asian selling pressure.

**[Crypto] #16: 200-Week Moving Average**
Edge: BTC has never closed below its 200-week MA on a weekly basis. Every touch has been a cycle bottom.
Action: The 200W MA is the ultimate buy zone. If price touches it, go max long with conviction.

**[Crypto] #17: Altcoin Season Index Timing**
Edge: When the Altcoin Season Index drops below 25, BTC dominance peaks within 2-3 weeks. Alts then outperform for 4-8 weeks.
Action: Rotate from BTC to alts when Altcoin Season Index bottoms below 25.

**[Crypto] #18: Post-Halving Cycle Timing**
Edge: BTC's cycle top has historically occurred 12-18 months after each halving. Average post-halving return: ~400%.
Action: Begin accumulating 6 months before halving. Scale out 12-18 months after.

**[Crypto] #19: Long-Term Holder Supply Shock**
Edge: When long-term holders (>155 days) hold 70%+ of supply and exchange reserves hit lows, supply shocks follow.
Action: Track LTH supply percentage. Above 70% with declining exchange reserves = imminent supply squeeze.

**[Crypto] #20: Negative Funding + Rising Price**
Edge: When funding is negative but price is rising, shorts are being squeezed and the move has legs. These trends persist 2-3x longer than average.
Action: When you see negative funding with price going up, add to longs. The shorts will capitulate.

**[Crypto] #21: Tether Minting Events**
Edge: Large USDT mints (>$500M) precede BTC rallies by 1-5 days with ~70% correlation historically.
Action: Set alerts for large Tether mints on Whale Alert. Front-run the liquidity injection.

**[Crypto] #22: Monthly Close Importance**
Edge: BTC monthly closes above key moving averages are far more significant than daily closes. Monthly close above 20M MA has 85% follow-through.
Action: Don't panic on daily noise. Wait for monthly close confirmation before making major allocation changes.

**[Crypto] #23: Miner Revenue Stress**
Edge: When miner revenue drops 50%+ from peak (hash price compression), miner capitulation forces selling. This creates bottoms.
Action: Track hash price (revenue per TH/s). Extreme lows = miner capitulation = buy zone.

**[Crypto] #24: Open Interest vs Volume Divergence**
Edge: Rising OI with declining volume = fake move building. The breakout will fail ~65% of the time.
Action: Confirm breakouts with rising volume AND rising OI. OI alone is a trap.

**[Crypto] #25: ETH Gas Fee Cycle**
Edge: When average gas fees drop below 10 gwei for extended periods, network activity has bottomed. Historically precedes ETH outperformance.
Action: Low gas = low activity = low prices = accumulation zone for ETH and ERC-20 tokens.

**[Crypto] #26: BTC Dominance Cycle**
Edge: BTC dominance rises in early bull markets (capital flows to safety) then falls as the cycle matures. The flip from rising to falling dominance signals alt rotation.
Action: Track BTC.D. Rising = stay in BTC. Falling from peak = rotate to alts.

**[Crypto] #27: Exchange Reserve Drawdown**
Edge: Total BTC on exchanges has been declining since 2020. Each new low in exchange reserves precedes a supply-driven rally.
Action: Exchange reserves hitting new lows = structural bullish signal. Don't fight the supply squeeze.

**[Crypto] #28: SOPR Reset**
Edge: When Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) drops below 1.0 during bull markets, holders are selling at a loss — a reset that reliably marks local bottoms.
Action: Buy SOPR dips below 1.0 in confirmed uptrends. It means weak hands are flushing.

**[Crypto] #29: Crypto Fear & Greed Below 10**
Edge: Fear & Greed Index below 10 ("Extreme Fear") has marked major bottoms with near-100% accuracy on a 90-day forward basis.
Action: Buy when everyone is terrified. F&G < 10 = back up the truck.

**[Crypto] #30: Stock-to-Flow Deviation**
Edge: When BTC trades >1 standard deviation below the S2F model price, mean reversion to model has occurred every cycle.
Action: Use S2F as a rough fair value anchor. Large deviations below = accumulation opportunities.

**[Crypto] #31: Perpetual vs Spot Volume Ratio**
Edge: When perp volume exceeds 10x spot volume, the market is leverage-driven and fragile. Corrections are sharper and faster.
Action: Track perp/spot ratio. Above 10x = reduce leverage, tighten stops. The market is paper-driven.

**[Crypto] #32: Ethereum Validator Queue**
Edge: A growing ETH validator queue (entry wait > 5 days) signals strong staking demand and reduces sell pressure.
Action: Long validator queue = bullish supply dynamics. When queue grows, ETH supply becomes more locked.

**[Crypto] #33: Bitcoin Realized Cap Growth**
Edge: Realized cap growth rate > 10% monthly signals new capital is entering the market, not just existing capital rotating.
Action: Rising realized cap = fresh money. This sustains rallies. Flat/declining = distribution.

**[Crypto] #34: Mempool Congestion Signal**
Edge: Sustained high mempool (>100MB unconfirmed tx) during rallies signals genuine demand, not just leverage. These rallies last longer.
Action: Check mempool during pumps. High mempool + rising price = organic. Empty mempool + rising price = leverage-driven, be cautious.

**[Crypto] #35: Monday Effect in Crypto**
Edge: Mondays historically show the weakest crypto returns. BTC averages -0.2% on Mondays vs +0.3% on Wednesdays/Thursdays.
Action: Use Monday weakness to accumulate. Set limit buys 2-3% below Sunday close.

**[Crypto] #36: Regulatory FUD Buy Signal**
Edge: SEC lawsuits, China bans, and regulatory crackdowns cause 15-30% drops that fully recover within 60-90 days ~80% of the time.
Action: Buy regulatory FUD if fundamentals are unchanged. The market overreacts to regulatory headlines.

**[Crypto] #37: Layer 1 Rotation Pattern**
Edge: Capital rotates through L1s sequentially: ETH → SOL → AVAX → newer L1s. The rotation takes 2-4 weeks per chain.
Action: When one L1 pumps 50%+, the next L1 in the rotation starts moving within 1-2 weeks. Position early.

**[Crypto] #38: NFT Volume as Sentiment Gauge**
Edge: NFT trading volume spikes precede broader crypto corrections by 2-3 weeks. Peak euphoria manifests in JPEGs first.
Action: When NFT volumes hit new highs, it's a late-cycle signal. Start reducing risk.

**[Crypto] #39: Basis Trade Carry**
Edge: BTC futures basis (spot vs quarterly futures) of 15%+ annualized is free money via cash-and-carry. Risk-free in crypto terms.
Action: When basis is elevated, sell futures + buy spot for the carry. Unwind when basis normalizes.

**[Crypto] #40: USDT Dominance as Inverse Signal**
Edge: USDT dominance (USDT market cap / total crypto market cap) rising = capital fleeing to stables = bearish. Falling = capital deploying = bullish.
Action: Track USDT.D as an inverse crypto indicator. Breakdowns in USDT.D = buy signals.

**[Crypto] #41: Airdrop Sell Pressure Window**
Edge: Major airdrops create 3-7 days of intense sell pressure. Tokens drop 30-60% from claim price, then stabilize.
Action: Never buy an airdrop token on day 1. Wait 5-7 days for sellers to exhaust, then evaluate.

**[Crypto] #42: Bitcoin Pi Cycle Top Indicator**
Edge: When the 111-day MA crosses above 2x the 350-day MA, BTC has historically been within 3 days of a cycle top.
Action: Use Pi Cycle as a cycle top warning. When the cross approaches, begin aggressive de-risking.

**[Crypto] #43: Stablecoin Depeg as Systemic Risk**
Edge: Any major stablecoin depegging below $0.97 triggers contagion selling across all crypto. Recovery takes 2-8 weeks.
Action: If USDT or USDC depegs, immediately reduce all crypto exposure by 50%+. Ask questions later.

**[Crypto] #44: New Exchange Listing Pump**
Edge: Tokens listed on Binance average +30% in the first 24h, then give back 50% of gains within 2 weeks.
Action: Sell into Binance listing pumps. Don't chase. If you missed the listing, wait 2 weeks for the pullback.

**[Crypto] #45: BTC Monthly RSI**
Edge: BTC monthly RSI above 90 has only occurred at absolute cycle tops. Below 30 only at cycle bottoms.
Action: Monthly RSI > 90 = sell everything. Monthly RSI < 30 = buy everything. Simple but effective.

**[Crypto] #46: Grayscale Outflow Exhaustion**
Edge: After GBTC ETF conversion, daily outflows eventually exhaust. When outflows drop below $100M/day after sustained selling, the selling pressure is done.
Action: Track ETF fund flows. When outflows decelerate, the supply overhang is clearing. Buy.

**[Crypto] #47: On-Chain Dormancy Flow**
Edge: When Entity-Adjusted Dormancy Flow drops below 250,000, long-term holders are not selling. Every prior instance = major bottom.
Action: Use dormancy flow as a macro buy signal. Below 250K = diamond hands are holding. Join them.

**[Crypto] #48: Crypto Correlation Spike**
Edge: When all crypto correlations go to 0.95+ (everything moves together), a regime change is imminent. Decorrelation follows within 2-4 weeks.
Action: Ultra-high intra-crypto correlation = macro is driving. Wait for decorrelation to pick individual winners.

**[Crypto] #49: DeFi Protocol Revenue Growth**
Edge: Protocols growing real revenue (fees to token holders) 20%+ month-over-month outperform the market by 3-5x over 6 months.
Action: Focus on DeFi tokens with growing protocol revenue, not just TVL. Revenue = sustainability.

**[Crypto] #50: Perpetual Funding Rate Farming**
Edge: Collecting funding on perps by being counter-trend (short when funding is high) generates 20-40% APY with moderate risk.
Action: Run a delta-neutral funding rate strategy: long spot + short perp when funding is elevated.

**[Crypto] #51: Bitcoin UTXO Age Distribution**
Edge: When coins aged 1-2 years start moving (UTXO age bands shifting), a macro trend change is starting. Early profit-taking or accumulation.
Action: Watch UTXO age distributions. Old coins moving = smart money repositioning. Follow the signal.

**[Crypto] #52: ETH Burn Rate Momentum**
Edge: When ETH daily burn exceeds issuance (deflationary days), sustained periods of deflation precede ETH outperformance vs BTC by ~15% over 30 days.
Action: Track ETH supply change. Deflationary periods = high demand. Go overweight ETH.

**[Crypto] #53: Crypto VC Funding as Leading Indicator**
Edge: VC funding into crypto peaks 6-12 months before the market peak. When VC deals decline, the top is forming.
Action: Track quarterly crypto VC investment. Declining VC interest = late cycle. Start planning exits.

**[Crypto] #54: Korean Premium (Kimchi Premium)**
Edge: Korean exchanges trading at 5%+ premium to global prices signals retail FOMO. This has marked local tops with ~70% accuracy.
Action: Monitor Korean premium. Above 5% = retail euphoria = time to reduce, not add.

**[Crypto] #55: Bitcoin Difficulty Ribbon Compression**
Edge: When mining difficulty ribbons compress (all difficulty MAs converge), weak miners have capitulated. Expansion signals recovery.
Action: Buy difficulty ribbon compression. Miner capitulation = forced selling over = bottom.

**[Crypto] #56: Taker Buy/Sell Ratio**
Edge: When the taker buy/sell ratio drops below 0.85 for 3+ consecutive days, selling exhaustion is near. Bounces follow ~70% of the time.
Action: Track taker ratio on major exchanges. Extreme sell-side dominance = capitulation = reversal incoming.

**[Crypto] #57: Token Unlock Schedule**
Edge: Large token unlocks (>5% of circulating supply) cause average -15% in the 7 days before unlock and -5% on unlock day.
Action: Short or avoid tokens with major unlocks approaching. Re-evaluate 1 week post-unlock.

**[Crypto] #58: DEX/CEX Volume Ratio**
Edge: Rising DEX/CEX volume ratio signals growing DeFi adoption. When ratio exceeds 15%, DeFi tokens tend to outperform.
Action: Track DEX vs CEX volumes. Rising DEX share = DeFi bull case strengthening.

**[Crypto] #59: Stablecoin Yield as Market Thermometer**
Edge: On-chain stablecoin yields above 10% = high demand for leverage = overheated. Below 2% = no demand = washed out.
Action: Stablecoin yields > 10% = take risk off. Below 2% = deploy capital. It's a sentiment gauge.

**[Crypto] #60: BTC Halving Pre-Rally**
Edge: BTC typically rallies 30-50% in the 6 months leading into a halving as anticipation builds. The real move comes after.
Action: Position 6-9 months before halving. Don't wait for the event — front-run the narrative.

**[Crypto] #61: Layer 2 Activity Growth**
Edge: Growing L2 transaction counts (Arbitrum, Optimism, Base) while mainnet stagnates signals an ecosystem health divergence. L2 growth is bullish for ETH.
Action: Track L2 metrics separately. L2 adoption is the real growth vector. Rising L2 activity = bullish ETH.

**[Crypto] #62: Whale Deposit to Exchanges**
Edge: When addresses holding >1000 BTC deposit to exchanges, selling follows within 24-72h. These deposits precede 5-10% drops ~60% of the time.
Action: Set whale alert filters for large exchange deposits. Reduce exposure on the signal.

**[Crypto] #63: Bitcoin Power Law Corridor**
Edge: BTC's price has followed a power law growth corridor since inception. The lower bound provides cycle bottom targets with high accuracy.
Action: Use the power law model for long-term fair value estimation. Buy below the model, sell above.

**[Crypto] #64: Crypto Options Put/Call Ratio**
Edge: When BTC options put/call ratio exceeds 0.7, protective put buying is elevated. Contrarian signal — rallies follow within 2 weeks ~65% of the time.
Action: High put/call = hedging overdone = bullish contrarian signal. Buy the fear.

**[Crypto] #65: Social Media Volume Spike**
Edge: When crypto social mentions spike 3x+ above the 30-day average, a local top forms within 48h ~70% of the time.
Action: Use social volume as a contrarian indicator. Extreme social buzz = exit signal.

**[Crypto] #66: BTC Miner Selling Pressure**
Edge: When miners sell more than they produce for 30+ consecutive days, forced capitulation is underway. This marks bottoms.
Action: Track miner outflow vs block rewards. Sustained over-selling = miner stress = buy zone.

**[Crypto] #67: Ethereum Gas Token Strategy**
Edge: Buy ETH gas tokens (like CHI or GST2 in early days) during low-gas periods and use during high-gas periods to save 30-40% on tx costs.
Action: Manage gas costs actively. Savings on gas compound over hundreds of transactions.

**[Crypto] #68: Crypto Market Cap Milestones**
Edge: Round number total crypto market cap levels ($1T, $2T, $3T) act as psychological resistance/support with 2-3 week consolidation zones.
Action: Expect chop around round-number total market caps. Don't force trades in these zones.

**[Crypto] #69: Protocol Fee Revenue Ranking**
Edge: The top 10 protocols by fees consistently outperform the broader market. Fee generation = real product-market fit.
Action: Allocate to the top fee-generating protocols. Revenue > narrative.

**[Crypto] #70: Staked ETH Withdrawal Queue**
Edge: Large ETH withdrawal queues (exit queue > 5 days) signal potential sell pressure. But historically, most unstaked ETH gets restaked.
Action: Don't panic at withdrawal queues. Track what percentage actually sells vs restakes. Usually < 30% sells.

**[Crypto] #71: BTC Weekly Close Above Key Levels**
Edge: A weekly close above a prior all-time high confirms the breakout with ~80% reliability. Fakeouts on daily timeframe are common; weekly is cleaner.
Action: Don't trade ATH breakouts on daily. Wait for weekly close confirmation.

**[Crypto] #72: Cross-Exchange Arbitrage Windows**
Edge: During high volatility, exchange price differences can exceed 1-2%. Arb windows last 30-120 seconds on average.
Action: Have accounts funded on 3+ exchanges. During volatility spikes, check for arb opportunities.

**[Crypto] #73: Token Supply on Exchanges vs DeFi**
Edge: When a token's supply on DEXes grows while CEX supply shrinks, DeFi users are accumulating. This is a stronger signal than CEX flows alone.
Action: Track on-chain token distribution between DEX LPs and CEX wallets for a complete picture.

**[Crypto] #74: BTC Seasonality — Q4 Performance**
Edge: Q4 has historically been BTC's strongest quarter, averaging +50% returns. October specifically averages +20%.
Action: Increase BTC allocation entering Q4. "Uptober" is a meme backed by data.

**[Crypto] #75: Leverage Ratio (OI / Market Cap)**
Edge: When aggregate leverage ratio (total OI / BTC market cap) exceeds 3.5%, a deleveraging event is imminent within 7 days ~65% of the time.
Action: Monitor leverage ratio. Above 3.5% = dangerous. Reduce leverage, move to spot.

**[Crypto] #76: Smart Contract Audit Signals**
Edge: DeFi protocols that undergo 3+ audits from reputable firms have 80% fewer exploits. Exploit risk = unhedged tail risk.
Action: Only allocate to multi-audited protocols. One audit isn't enough. Check audit history before deploying capital.

**[Crypto] #77: BTC Accumulation Addresses**
Edge: Addresses that only receive BTC and never spend (accumulation addresses) growing = strong holder base forming.
Action: Track accumulation address growth. Acceleration in these addresses = conviction buying.

**[Crypto] #78: Crypto Futures Term Structure**
Edge: When the futures curve flips from contango (normal) to backwardation (front month > back month), it signals acute selling pressure. Historically precedes further downside.
Action: Monitor term structure. Backwardation = bearish near-term. Steep contango = bullish, traders paying premium for upside.

**[Crypto] #79: BTC Correlation with Traditional Markets Decoupling**
Edge: When BTC-SPX 30-day correlation drops below 0.2, BTC is trading on its own fundamentals. These periods produce the strongest trend moves.
Action: Low correlation to equities = crypto-native narrative driving. Trust the crypto-specific signals more.

**[Crypto] #80: End-of-Month Window Dressing**
Edge: Crypto funds rebalance at month-end, creating predictable 2-3% volatility in the last 48h of each month. Positions get unwound for reporting.
Action: Be aware of month-end flows. Don't mistake fund rebalancing for organic moves. Fade month-end extremes.

---

## RISK MANAGEMENT (81–140)

**[Risk] #81: The 1% Rule**
Edge: Risking no more than 1% of portfolio per trade ensures you can lose 20 trades in a row and still have 82% of capital remaining.
Action: Calculate position size so your stop-loss equals exactly 1% of total portfolio value. No exceptions.

**[Risk] #82: Volatility-Adjusted Position Sizing**
Edge: Sizing positions by inverse volatility (e.g., ATR-based) produces 20-30% better risk-adjusted returns vs fixed sizing.
Action: Divide your base position size by (asset ATR / average ATR). Higher vol = smaller position.

**[Risk] #83: Kelly Criterion Half-Sizing**
Edge: Full Kelly sizing maximizes geometric growth but has massive drawdowns. Half-Kelly achieves 75% of the growth with 50% of the drawdown.
Action: Calculate Kelly fraction, then use half. f* = (bp - q) / b, then size = f*/2.

**[Risk] #84: Maximum Drawdown Circuit Breaker**
Edge: Traders who stop trading after a 10% drawdown and reassess recover faster than those who "trade through it." Revenge trading extends drawdowns 2-3x.
Action: Set a hard 10% monthly drawdown limit. Hit it = stop trading for 48h minimum. Review, don't react.

**[Risk] #85: Correlation-Adjusted Portfolio Heat**
Edge: Holding 5 highly correlated positions at 2% risk each isn't 10% risk — it's closer to 8% due to correlation. But it CAN act as 10% in a crash.
Action: Sum position risks and multiply by average pairwise correlation for true portfolio heat. Keep total heat < 6%.

**[Risk] #86: Gap Risk Overnight**
Edge: Crypto gaps are rare (24/7 markets) but CME futures gap every weekend. Equities gap overnight. Gaps bypass stops.
Action: For assets with market closes, reduce position to 50% of your max before close. Gap risk is unhedgeable.

**[Risk] #87: Stop Loss Placement Beyond Noise**
Edge: Stops placed within 1 ATR of entry get hit by noise 65% of the time. Stops at 2 ATR survive noise and catch real moves.
Action: Place stops at minimum 1.5-2x ATR from entry. Tighter stops = more losses from noise.

**[Risk] #88: Time-Based Stops**
Edge: If a trade hasn't moved in your favor within 3x your expected hold period, the thesis is broken. Time stops prevent capital lock-up.
Action: Set time-based exits. If a swing trade hasn't worked in 2 weeks, exit regardless of P&L.

**[Risk] #89: Risk-Reward Minimum 2:1**
Edge: A 2:1 R:R with a 40% win rate is profitable. A 1:1 R:R needs >50% win rate. Most traders don't have >50%.
Action: Never enter a trade without at least 2:1 reward-to-risk. If you can't find it, skip the trade.

**[Risk] #90: Position Sizing by Conviction**
Edge: Sizing all trades equally wastes edge. Your highest-conviction setups should be 2-3x your standard size.
Action: Use a 3-tier sizing model: Low conviction = 0.5x, Standard = 1x, High conviction = 2x base size.

**[Risk] #91: Hedging with Options vs Stops**
Edge: Buying puts costs premium but can't be stopped out. In volatile markets, options hedges outperform stop-losses by 15-25%.
Action: In high-volatility regimes, consider buying puts instead of using tight stops. The cost is your "insurance premium."

**[Risk] #92: Maximum Sector Concentration**
Edge: Portfolios with >40% in a single sector underperform risk-adjusted by 25% over 5 years vs diversified portfolios.
Action: Cap any single sector at 30% of portfolio. Includes crypto as one sector in a broader portfolio.

**[Risk] #93: Scaling Into Positions**
Edge: Entering in 3 tranches (33/33/33) reduces average entry cost by 5-10% vs lump-sum entry on winning trades, and limits damage on losers.
Action: Never go full size immediately. Enter 1/3 at initial level, 1/3 at first confirmation, 1/3 at breakout/retest.

**[Risk] #94: The Anti-Martingale Principle**
Edge: Adding to winners (pyramiding) and cutting losers produces 40-60% better returns than adding to losers (averaging down).
Action: Only add to positions that are already profitable. Never average down without a predetermined plan.

**[Risk] #95: Portfolio Heat Map**
Edge: Tracking your total portfolio risk in real-time (sum of all position risks) prevents accidental overexposure during "target-rich" environments.
Action: Maintain a live spreadsheet of every open position's risk. Total should never exceed 6-8% of portfolio.

**[Risk] #96: Black Swan Protection (1-2% of Portfolio)**
Edge: Allocating 1-2% to far OTM puts provides 5-10x payoff in crashes. Over a decade, this "insurance" pays for itself.
Action: Spend 0.5% of portfolio quarterly on tail-risk hedges. Far OTM puts or VIX calls.

**[Risk] #97: Reducing Size After Consecutive Wins**
Edge: After 5+ consecutive wins, traders increase risk-taking and the next loss is disproportionately large. Reversion to mean applies to win streaks.
Action: After 4 consecutive wins, reduce position sizes by 25%. Overconfidence is a risk factor.

**[Risk] #98: Account Segregation**
Edge: Keeping trading capital separate from savings prevents emotional size increases and makes true P&L tracking possible.
Action: Maintain separate accounts: trading, savings, and expenses. Never transfer from savings to trading.

**[Risk] #99: Intraday vs Overnight Risk Budget**
Edge: Overnight positions carry 2-3x more risk than intraday (gaps, news). Allocate risk budgets accordingly.
Action: Your overnight risk budget should be 50% of your intraday budget. Bigger overnight = smaller size.

**[Risk] #100: Liquidity Risk Premium**
Edge: Illiquid assets (small-cap alts, low-volume tokens) need 2-3x wider stops and 50% smaller sizes due to slippage risk.
Action: Multiply your normal stop width by the illiquidity factor. If you can't exit in 2 minutes, halve the size.

**[Risk] #101: Max Open Positions Rule**
Edge: Cognitive load increases errors. Traders managing >8 positions simultaneously make 40% more mistakes.
Action: Limit open positions to 5-8 maximum. If you want a new trade, close an existing one first.

**[Risk] #102: Pre-Trade Checklist**
Edge: Using a written checklist before every trade reduces impulsive entries by 60% and improves win rate by 10-15%.
Action: Create a 5-point checklist: Setup? Risk defined? R:R > 2:1? Portfolio heat OK? Thesis clear? All yes = trade.

**[Risk] #103: Weekly Risk Review**
Edge: Traders who review risk metrics weekly (drawdown, win rate, average R:R) improve performance 20% faster than those who don't.
Action: Every Friday, review: total P&L, max drawdown, win rate, average winner vs loser, portfolio heat.

**[Risk] #104: Asymmetric Risk Management**
Edge: Letting winners run (trailing stops) while cutting losers quickly (hard stops) creates positive skew that compounds wealth.
Action: Hard stop for losses (no flexibility). Trailing stop for winners (let them breathe). Never reverse this.

**[Risk] #105: Currency Exposure Awareness**
Edge: If you're trading crypto in USD but your expenses are in another currency, you have hidden FX risk that can cost 5-10% annually.
Action: Hedge your FX exposure or at least account for it in your returns calculation.

**[Risk] #106: Leverage Degradation**
Edge: Leveraged products (3x ETFs, perpetuals with funding) degrade over time. A 3x leveraged product loses ~15% annually to volatility decay alone.
Action: Use leverage only for short-term trades. Never hold leveraged products as long-term positions.

**[Risk] #107: Fat Tail Awareness**
Edge: Financial returns have fat tails. A "6 sigma" event in crypto occurs every 18 months, not once in a million years.
Action: Size as if a 20% daily move can happen any day. Because in crypto, it can and does.

**[Risk] #108: Drawdown Recovery Math**
Edge: A 50% loss requires a 100% gain to recover. A 20% loss only needs 25%. The math punishes large drawdowns disproportionately.
Action: Focus on avoiding large drawdowns above all else. Capital preservation > capital appreciation.

**[Risk] #109: Correlation Regime Changes**
Edge: Asset correlations increase during crises (correlation goes to 1 in panics). Your "diversified" portfolio isn't diversified when it matters most.
Action: Stress-test your portfolio with correlation = 0.9 for all assets. If it survives, you're sized correctly.

**[Risk] #110: News Event Risk Reduction**
Edge: Halving position size before major scheduled events (FOMC, CPI, earnings) reduces average drawdown by 30% with only 10% reduction in returns.
Action: Cut positions by 50% before major macro events. Re-enter after the dust settles.

**[Risk] #111: Maximum Loss Per Day**
Edge: A daily loss limit of 3% prevents emotional spiraling. 80% of traders' worst months come from a single catastrophic day.
Action: Set a daily loss limit of 2-3% of portfolio. Hit it = walk away. No exceptions.

**[Risk] #112: Risk of Ruin Calculation**
Edge: Knowing your exact risk of ruin (probability of losing X% of capital given your stats) prevents unconscious suicide-by-leverage.
Action: Calculate risk of ruin: R = ((1-edge)/(1+edge))^(capital/risk_per_trade). Keep R < 1%.

**[Risk] #113: Correlated Stop Clusters**
Edge: If all your stops are in the same area (e.g., below a key support), a single move wipes all positions simultaneously.
Action: Stagger stops across different levels and timeframes. Avoid clustering all risk at one price level.

**[Risk] #114: Counterparty Risk in Crypto**
Edge: FTX proved that exchange counterparty risk is real. Keeping >30% of crypto on a single exchange is reckless.
Action: Spread holdings across 3+ exchanges and self-custody. No single exchange should hold > 25% of your crypto.

**[Risk] #115: Emotional Risk Quotient**
Edge: Trading while angry, euphoric, or sleep-deprived reduces performance by 30-50%. Emotional state is a risk factor.
Action: Rate your emotional state 1-10 before trading. Below 6 = halve position sizes. Below 4 = don't trade.

**[Risk] #116: Rolling Stop-Loss Method**
Edge: Moving your stop to breakeven after 1R of profit locks in a free trade. Win rate drops slightly but average trade becomes positive.
Action: Once a trade is up 1R, move stop to breakeven. You now have a free trade.

**[Risk] #117: Maximum Leverage by Asset Class**
Edge: Appropriate leverage by volatility: BTC max 3x, ETH max 2x, altcoins max 1.5x, stables 10x. Anything higher = gambling.
Action: Set hard leverage limits per asset class based on historical volatility. Don't negotiate with yourself.

**[Risk] #118: Win Rate vs Payoff Ratio Tradeoff**
Edge: You can have a 30% win rate and be hugely profitable if your average winner is 5x your average loser. Win rate alone is meaningless.
Action: Track your payoff ratio (avg win / avg loss) alongside win rate. The product determines profitability.

**[Risk] #119: Recovery Period Budgeting**
Edge: After a 15% drawdown, the average recovery time is 3-6 months with disciplined trading. Rushed recovery attempts extend this to 12+ months.
Action: Budget recovery time. After significant drawdowns, reduce size for a minimum of 30 trades before returning to normal sizing.

**[Risk] #120: Systematic vs Discretionary Risk**
Edge: Systematic traders with backtested rules have 40% lower maximum drawdowns than discretionary traders over 5-year periods.
Action: Systematize at least your risk management rules even if entries are discretionary. Rules-based risk, flexible entries.

**[Risk] #121: Position Size vs Confidence Calibration**
Edge: Most traders are overconfident. If you rate a trade 80% probable, it's likely 55-60%. Calibrate by tracking prediction accuracy.
Action: Keep a prediction log. Rate confidence for each trade, then compare to actual outcomes. Adjust sizing to calibrated confidence.

**[Risk] #122: Hedging Costs as Insurance**
Edge: Spending 2-5% of annual returns on hedges (puts, shorts, insurance positions) reduces max drawdown by 30-50%.
Action: Budget for hedging. It's not lost money — it's insurance premium. 3% annual cost for tail protection is cheap.

**[Risk] #123: Overnight Funding Cost Awareness**
Edge: Perpetual futures funding can cost 0.05-0.3% per 8 hours. Over a month, that's 5-30% annualized drag on leveraged longs.
Action: Factor funding costs into your expected return. If your edge is < funding cost, the trade is negative EV.

**[Risk] #124: Liquidity Withdrawal Risk**
Edge: During market stress, liquidity disappears. Bid-ask spreads widen 5-10x. Your planned exit at -2% becomes -8%.
Action: Always assume your worst-case exit will be 2-3x worse than planned. Size accordingly.

**[Risk] #125: Beta-Adjusted Position Sizing**
Edge: A 2x beta asset with 2% risk is really 4% effective risk to the portfolio. Beta-adjusting prevents hidden overexposure.
Action: Multiply your intended risk by the asset's beta to BTC or SPX. Keep beta-adjusted total risk < 6%.

**[Risk] #126: Drawdown Half-Life**
Edge: The longer you're in a drawdown, the less likely you are to recover quickly. Drawdowns > 60 days have a 40% chance of deepening.
Action: If you're in drawdown for > 45 days, cut all positions by 50% and reset. Extended drawdowns mean your strategy isn't working in this regime.

**[Risk] #127: Stop Placement Using Market Structure**
Edge: Stops below structural levels (prior swing lows, volume nodes) survive 20% better than fixed-percentage stops.
Action: Place stops below market structure, not at arbitrary percentages. Structure > math for stop placement.

**[Risk] #128: Maximum Capital at Risk Across All Markets**
Edge: Total capital at risk across all markets (crypto, stocks, forex) should never exceed 10% simultaneously. This includes all open positions.
Action: Sum risk across ALL markets, not just within one. 5% crypto risk + 5% equity risk = 10% total portfolio risk.

**[Risk] #129: Profit-Taking Discipline**
Edge: Taking partial profits at 2R and 3R while trailing the remainder produces 15% better risk-adjusted returns than all-or-nothing exits.
Action: Scale out: sell 1/3 at 2R, 1/3 at 3R, trail the final 1/3. Lock in gains while keeping upside.

**[Risk] #130: Risk Per Day Compounding**
Edge: If you risk 1% per trade and take 3 trades/day that all lose, you've lost 3% in a day. Daily risk = per-trade risk × max trades.
Action: Set a max number of trades per day (3-5). Your daily risk = per-trade risk × max daily trades. Keep this < 3%.

**[Risk] #131: Strategy Diversification**
Edge: Running 2-3 uncorrelated strategies reduces portfolio drawdown by 30-40% vs a single strategy with the same total risk.
Action: Diversify across strategies (trend following, mean reversion, carry). Low correlation between strategies is key.

**[Risk] #132: Tail Risk Scenario Planning**
Edge: Traders who have a written plan for "what if BTC drops 40% today" execute 3x faster and more calmly during actual crashes.
Action: Write a playbook for: 20% flash crash, exchange hack, stablecoin depeg, regulatory ban. Practice the plan mentally.

**[Risk] #133: Rolling Returns Analysis**
Edge: Your backtest looks great on a start-to-end basis, but rolling 1-year returns might show periods of -30%. Rolling analysis reveals hidden risk.
Action: Always analyze rolling returns, not just total returns. The worst rolling period is your likely future drawdown.

**[Risk] #134: Margin Call Prevention Buffer**
Edge: Keeping 50% of your maintenance margin as a buffer prevents forced liquidation during temporary drawdowns that recover.
Action: If maintenance margin is $10K, keep $15K in the account. The buffer prevents unnecessary liquidations.

**[Risk] #135: Risk-Off Regime Detection**
Edge: When VIX > 30 AND BTC funding goes negative AND DXY is rising, it's a triple risk-off signal. Reduce all exposure by 50%+.
Action: Create a simple risk regime model. When 3+ risk-off signals align, go defensive regardless of individual position setups.

**[Risk] #136: Portfolio Insurance via Cash**
Edge: Holding 20-30% cash during uncertain periods underperforms in bull markets by 5-8% but outperforms in bear markets by 15-20%.
Action: Cash is a position. In uncertain regimes, 20-30% cash allocation provides optionality and emotional stability.

**[Risk] #137: Smart Loss-Taking**
Edge: Taking small losses quickly (within 1-2 candles of invalidation) preserves capital for the next setup. Holding losers ties up capital and mental energy.
Action: If your entry thesis is invalidated (not just price, but the reason for the trade), exit immediately. Don't wait for your stop.

**[Risk] #138: Risk Management During Winning Streaks**
Edge: Winners create complacency. Increasing size during winning streaks leads to giving back 50-80% of gains in the subsequent losing streak.
Action: Use a ratchet: increase size only after total account grows 20%+. Then increase by 10%, not proportionally.

**[Risk] #139: Cross-Margin vs Isolated Margin**
Edge: Isolated margin limits loss to the position. Cross-margin can liquidate your entire account. The convenience isn't worth the risk.
Action: Use isolated margin for every position. Cross-margin only for hedged portfolios where you understand the netting.

**[Risk] #140: Annual Risk Budget**
Edge: Setting an annual risk budget (max acceptable drawdown for the year) prevents slow bleed. -15% annual budget = you can have 15 losing 1% trades.
Action: Set an annual max drawdown budget (e.g., -15%). Track cumulative losses. When you've used 75% of the budget, reduce size dramatically.

## CROSS-MARKET (141–180)

**[Cross-Market] #141: BTC-SPX Rolling Correlation**
Edge: BTC-SPX 90-day correlation oscillates between 0 and 0.8. When correlation > 0.7, crypto trades as a risk asset. When < 0.2, it trades independently.
Action: Check BTC-SPX correlation before trading crypto. High correlation = trade macro first, crypto second.

**[Cross-Market] #142: DXY Inverse Relationship**
Edge: BTC has a -0.6 to -0.8 correlation with DXY during macro-driven regimes. Dollar up = crypto down, with 2-5 day lag.
Action: Monitor DXY as a leading indicator. DXY breakout = reduce crypto longs. DXY breakdown = add crypto longs.

**[Cross-Market] #143: Gold-BTC Correlation Shift**
Edge: Gold and BTC correlation has increased from 0 to 0.3 since 2020. Both benefit from money printing / fiat debasement narratives.
Action: When gold breaks to new highs, BTC follows within 1-3 months. Gold leads the "sound money" narrative.

**[Cross-Market] #144: Bond Yield Impact on Crypto**
Edge: Rising 10Y yields above 4.5% correlate with crypto selloffs. Every 50bp rise in yields = ~10% crypto drawdown historically.
Action: Watch the 10Y yield. Sharp rises = reduce crypto risk. Rate cuts / falling yields = add crypto.

**[Cross-Market] #145: NASDAQ as Crypto Leading Indicator**
Edge: NASDAQ-100 leads BTC by 1-3 days during high-correlation regimes. QQQ closing above its 50-day MA = bullish for BTC within 48h.
Action: Use QQQ as a leading signal for BTC during high-correlation periods. QQQ ripping = crypto follows.

**[Cross-Market] #146: VIX Mean Reversion for Crypto Timing**
Edge: VIX spikes above 30 correlate with crypto capitulation lows. VIX reverting from 35+ to below 25 = strong crypto buy signal.
Action: Buy crypto when VIX starts declining from elevated levels (>30). Fear is subsiding across all markets.

**[Cross-Market] #147: Commodity Super Cycle and Crypto**
Edge: Commodity bull markets (oil, copper, gold all rising) historically coincide with alternative asset outperformance including crypto.
Action: Track the Bloomberg Commodity Index. Sustained uptrend = reflationary environment = bullish crypto macro.

**[Cross-Market] #148: USD/JPY as Risk Barometer**
Edge: USD/JPY is a global risk sentiment proxy. Sharp yen strengthening (USD/JPY falling) signals risk-off and precedes crypto selloffs by 1-3 days.
Action: Watch USD/JPY. Sharp drops = carry trade unwinding = risk-off = reduce crypto exposure.

**[Cross-Market] #149: FOMC Day Pattern**
Edge: BTC typically sells off 2-3% in the 24h before FOMC, then rallies 3-5% in the 48h after (regardless of the decision) ~65% of the time.
Action: Reduce before FOMC, add back 2-4 hours after the announcement once direction establishes.

**[Cross-Market] #150: Equity Market Breadth for Crypto**
Edge: When NYSE advance/decline line diverges from SPX (fewer stocks participating), risk-off is coming. Crypto selloffs follow within 1-2 weeks.
Action: Track market breadth. Narrowing breadth (few stocks driving gains) = late cycle = reduce crypto risk.

**[Cross-Market] #151: Oil Price Shocks and Crypto**
Edge: Oil spikes > 20% in a month create stagflation fears, which are initially bearish for crypto (-10 to -15%) but bullish long-term (debasement hedge).
Action: Oil shock = reduce crypto short-term. But start accumulating 2-4 weeks later for the debasement narrative.

**[Cross-Market] #152: Chinese Yuan Devaluation Signal**
Edge: CNY devaluation (USD/CNY rising above 7.3) historically coincides with Chinese capital flight into BTC. Correlation: ~0.5.
Action: Watch USD/CNY. Yuan weakening above key levels = expect Chinese buying pressure on BTC via OTC desks.

**[Cross-Market] #153: Copper/Gold Ratio as Growth Signal**
Edge: Copper/gold ratio rising = growth expectations increasing = risk-on = bullish for crypto. Falling = recession fears = bearish.
Action: Track copper/gold ratio as a growth proxy. Rising = add risk. Falling = reduce risk.

**[Cross-Market] #154: High Yield Spreads Leading Indicator**
Edge: High yield bond spreads widening above 500bp precede broad risk asset selloffs including crypto by 1-2 weeks.
Action: Monitor HY spreads. Widening spreads = credit stress = reduce all risk asset exposure including crypto.

**[Cross-Market] #155: Treasury Yield Curve and Crypto Cycles**
Edge: Yield curve uninversion (2s10s going from negative to positive) historically signals recession arrival. Crypto bottoms ~6 months after uninversion.
Action: Curve uninversion = recession starting = crypto pain short-term. But start accumulating because the bottom is 3-6 months away.

**[Cross-Market] #156: M2 Money Supply and Crypto**
Edge: Global M2 growth has ~0.7 correlation with BTC price on a 3-month lag. M2 expansion = crypto appreciation.
Action: Track global M2 growth. Rising M2 = liquidity tailwind for crypto. M2 contraction = headwind.

**[Cross-Market] #157: CPI Print Crypto Reaction Pattern**
Edge: Hot CPI prints (above consensus) cause immediate 3-5% crypto drops, but 70% of the drop recovers within 48h.
Action: Don't sell into CPI dumps. If anything, buy the dip 4-6 hours after a hot CPI print.

**[Cross-Market] #158: European Market Open Impact**
Edge: European market open (3 AM ET) creates a secondary liquidity injection. BTC trends established at EU open persist through London session ~60% of the time.
Action: Pay attention to the EU open. The London session sets the daily direction more often than the Asian session.

**[Cross-Market] #159: Real Yields and Crypto Valuation**
Edge: Real yields (nominal - inflation) going negative = positive for crypto. Negative real yields penalize cash/bonds and push capital into alternatives.
Action: Track real yields (TIPS yields). Deeply negative = very bullish crypto. Rising/positive = headwind.

**[Cross-Market] #160: Equity Sector Rotation and Crypto**
Edge: When money rotates from growth (XLK) into defensive sectors (XLU, XLP), risk-off is beginning. Crypto follows growth stocks.
Action: Monitor sector rotation. Growth → Defensive rotation = reduce crypto. Defensive → Growth = add crypto.

**[Cross-Market] #161: PMI Data and Crypto**
Edge: Global manufacturing PMIs above 50 (expansion) correlate with crypto bull markets. Below 50 for 3+ months = crypto bear market likely.
Action: Track global PMIs. Sustained expansion = reflationary trade = bullish crypto. Contraction = cautious.

**[Cross-Market] #162: Bank Earnings and Crypto**
Edge: Strong bank earnings (especially trading revenue) signal healthy risk appetite. Bank stocks leading = institutional risk-on = crypto benefits.
Action: Bank earnings season can signal risk appetite. Strong bank results = institutions are taking risk = crypto tailwind.

**[Cross-Market] #163: Emerging Market Currencies and Crypto**
Edge: EM currency crises (Turkish lira, Argentine peso, Nigerian naira collapse) drive local crypto adoption and volume. BTC premium on local exchanges spikes 10-30%.
Action: Track EM currency stability. EM crises = crypto adoption driver in those regions. Global narrative shifts.

**[Cross-Market] #164: S&P 500 Seasonality and Crypto**
Edge: "Sell in May" applies to crypto too. May-October crypto returns average 5% vs November-April average of 40%.
Action: Allocate more aggressively November through April. Reduce exposure (or hedge) May through October.

**[Cross-Market] #165: Correlation Breakdowns as Signals**
Edge: When a long-standing correlation breaks (e.g., BTC stops following NASDAQ), it signals a regime change. The new regime persists 3-6 months.
Action: When correlations break, reassess your framework. The old playbook no longer works. Adapt or sit out.

**[Cross-Market] #166: Global Liquidity Index**
Edge: An aggregate of major central bank balance sheets (Fed + ECB + BOJ + PBOC) leads crypto by 2-3 months with ~0.7 correlation.
Action: Build a global liquidity dashboard. Central bank balance sheets expanding = add crypto. Contracting = reduce.

**[Cross-Market] #167: Crude Oil Inventory and Risk Sentiment**
Edge: Unexpected crude oil inventory draws signal demand strength = reflationary = risk-on. Surprise builds = demand weakness = risk-off.
Action: Wednesday EIA crude data can move risk sentiment. Large draws = buy risk including crypto.

**[Cross-Market] #168: Swiss Franc as Safe Haven Signal**
Edge: USD/CHF dropping sharply signals flight to safety. When the franc surges, risk assets including crypto drop within 24-48h.
Action: CHF strength = fear rising. Reduce risk exposure. CHF weakness = risk appetite returning.

**[Cross-Market] #169: Semiconductor Stocks Leading Indicator**
Edge: Semiconductor stocks (SOX index) lead NASDAQ by 2-4 weeks and crypto by 3-6 weeks. SOX breakout = risk-on is coming.
Action: Watch the SOX index. New highs in semis = liquidity flowing into growth/tech = crypto benefits.

**[Cross-Market] #170: Bond Market Liquidity Stress**
Edge: When the MOVE index (bond volatility) spikes above 150, treasury market dysfunction is occurring. All assets sell to raise cash including crypto.
Action: MOVE index > 150 = treasury stress = sell everything, raise cash. This is systemic risk.

**[Cross-Market] #171: Dollar Milkshake Theory**
Edge: In a dollar shortage (DXY rising sharply above 110), all non-USD assets suffer. BTC can drop 30%+ despite being a "hedge."
Action: Extreme dollar strength is bad for everything. DXY > 110 = heavily reduce all non-USD asset exposure.

**[Cross-Market] #172: Options Expiry Cross-Market**
Edge: Major options expiry days (monthly equity, quarterly crypto) create volatility compression before expiry and expansion after. Time your entries post-expiry.
Action: Avoid initiating positions in the 48h before major options expiries. The pin action creates false signals.

**[Cross-Market] #173: Inflation Breakevens and Crypto**
Edge: Rising 5Y inflation breakevens (market's inflation expectation) are bullish for crypto as an inflation hedge. Above 2.5% = strong tailwind.
Action: Track 5Y breakevens. Rising = inflation expectations growing = crypto hedge narrative strengthens.

**[Cross-Market] #174: US-China Trade Tensions and Crypto**
Edge: Escalating US-China tensions create uncertainty that's initially bearish for crypto (-5 to -10%) but drives longer-term adoption as neutral settlement.
Action: Trade tensions = short-term pain, long-term gain for crypto. Buy the dip if fundamentals haven't changed.

**[Cross-Market] #175: Small Cap/Large Cap Ratio**
Edge: Russell 2000 / S&P 500 ratio rising = risk appetite broadening = bullish for crypto. Falling ratio = flight to quality = bearish.
Action: Track IWM/SPY ratio. Risk appetite widening to small caps means it'll reach crypto next.

**[Cross-Market] #176: Australian Dollar as Risk Proxy**
Edge: AUD/USD is a global risk proxy (commodity currency). AUD strength = global growth = bullish for risk assets including crypto.
Action: Watch AUD/USD. Rising AUD = global risk-on environment. Falling AUD = risk-off.

**[Cross-Market] #177: Credit Default Swaps and Systemic Risk**
Edge: Investment-grade CDS spreads widening above 100bp signals systemic credit stress. Crypto sells off 15-25% during credit events.
Action: Monitor IG CDS spreads. Widening = credit stress building = reduce all risk exposure preemptively.

**[Cross-Market] #178: Nikkei 225 and Asian Session Crypto**
Edge: Nikkei 225 direction during the Asian session has 0.5 correlation with BTC direction during the same session. Nikkei pumping = BTC pumps.
Action: Check Nikkei direction at Asian open. Strong Nikkei = expect supportive BTC price action during Asian hours.

**[Cross-Market] #179: Quarterly End Rebalancing Flows**
Edge: Quarter-end rebalancing by pension funds and institutions creates predictable equity buying/selling. This pulls liquidity from crypto for 3-5 days.
Action: Expect reduced crypto liquidity in the last week of each quarter. Widen stops, reduce size.

**[Cross-Market] #180: Geopolitical Risk Premium**
Edge: Geopolitical events (wars, sanctions) initially dump crypto 10-15%, but BTC recovers within 30 days as "uncensorable money" narrative kicks in.
Action: Geopolitical shocks = buy the dip on BTC specifically. Not alts, not DeFi — BTC as digital gold.

## PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION (181–200)

**[Portfolio] #181: Core-Satellite Model**
Edge: 60-70% in core holdings (BTC, ETH) with 30-40% in satellite positions (alts, DeFi, trades) outperforms all-alt portfolios by 40% risk-adjusted.
Action: Build a core of BTC/ETH (60-70%). Use the satellite allocation (30-40%) for active trading and higher-risk bets.

**[Portfolio] #182: Rebalancing Frequency**
Edge: Monthly rebalancing outperforms daily rebalancing by 3-5% annually due to reduced transaction costs and letting winners run.
Action: Rebalance monthly, not daily. Check allocations on the 1st of each month, rebalance if any position drifts >5% from target.

**[Portfolio] #183: Equal Weight vs Market Cap Weight**
Edge: Equal-weighted crypto portfolios outperform market-cap-weighted portfolios by 15-25% annually, though with 30% more volatility.
Action: For a diversified crypto portfolio, consider equal-weighting your positions rather than market-cap weighting.

**[Portfolio] #184: Cash as a Strategic Asset**
Edge: A permanent 10-20% cash allocation provides rebalancing fuel during drawdowns. Portfolios with cash allocation had 20% lower max drawdowns.
Action: Always hold 10-20% in stablecoins or cash. This is your "dry powder" for opportunities during crashes.

**[Portfolio] #185: The 5% Altcoin Rule**
Edge: No single altcoin should exceed 5% of your total portfolio. This limits damage from any single blow-up (which is common in crypto).
Action: Cap individual altcoin positions at 5% of portfolio. BTC and ETH can be larger (20-30% each).

**[Portfolio] #186: Vintage Year Diversification**
Edge: Not all entry points are created equal. Spreading entries across months/quarters reduces sequence-of-returns risk by 30%.
Action: Don't invest all capital at once. Spread entries across 6-12 months via DCA for core positions.

**[Portfolio] #187: Uncorrelated Alpha Sources**
Edge: Adding uncorrelated return streams (DeFi yields, funding arbitrage, liquidity provision) to a directional portfolio improves Sharpe ratio by 0.3-0.5.
Action: Diversify across return sources, not just assets. Direction + yield + arb = more robust returns.

**[Portfolio] #188: Tax-Loss Harvesting in Crypto**
Edge: Harvesting crypto losses (where allowed by jurisdiction — no wash sale rule in many places) can save 10-15% of annual tax liability.
Action: Review portfolio quarterly for tax-loss harvesting opportunities. Sell losers, immediately rebuy (check local tax rules first).

**[Portfolio] #189: Portfolio Construction by Thesis**
Edge: Group positions by thesis (inflation hedge, L1 growth, DeFi adoption) rather than just asset class. This reveals true diversification.
Action: Categorize every position by investment thesis. If 80% of positions share one thesis, you're concentrated, not diversified.

**[Portfolio] #190: Risk Parity Approach**
Edge: Allocating so each position contributes equal risk (not equal capital) improves risk-adjusted returns by 20-30% vs equal capital allocation.
Action: Size positions inversely proportional to their volatility. Low-vol BTC gets bigger allocation, high-vol alts get smaller.

**[Portfolio] #191: Maximum Drawdown-Based Allocation**
Edge: Allocating based on max historical drawdown (not expected return) protects against worst-case scenarios. Size = target risk / max historical drawdown.
Action: If BTC max drawdown = 80%, and your target per-position drawdown is 8%, allocate max 10% to BTC.

**[Portfolio] #192: Barbell Strategy**
Edge: 80% in safe assets (BTC, stablecoins) + 20% in high-risk/high-reward (small caps, early DeFi) outperforms a medium-risk portfolio by 10% annually.
Action: Go barbell: very safe (80%) and very risky (20%). Avoid the mushy middle of medium-risk positions.

**[Portfolio] #193: Rebalancing Bands**
Edge: Rebalancing only when positions deviate >25% from target weight (bands) outperforms calendar-based rebalancing by 2-3% annually.
Action: Don't rebalance on a schedule. Rebalance when any position drifts 25%+ from target allocation. This captures momentum.

**[Portfolio] #194: Conviction-Weighted Portfolio**
Edge: Weighting positions by research depth and conviction (not just opportunity) correlates with 15-20% better outcomes.
Action: Your most-researched positions should be your largest. If you can't explain the thesis in 30 seconds, reduce the position.

**[Portfolio] #195: Liquidity Tier Allocation**
Edge: Allocating by liquidity tiers (50% highly liquid, 30% medium, 20% illiquid) ensures you can always raise cash in a crisis.
Action: Ensure 50%+ of portfolio can be liquidated within 1 hour. Never let illiquid positions dominate.

**[Portfolio] #196: Benchmark Selection**
Edge: Measuring against the wrong benchmark leads to bad decisions. A crypto portfolio should benchmark against BTC, not USD.
Action: Benchmark your crypto portfolio against BTC. If you're not beating BTC, you're just adding risk for nothing. Consider just holding BTC.

**[Portfolio] #197: Strategic Reserve Position**
Edge: Keeping a "strategic reserve" (BTC held through all conditions, never traded) provides a psychological anchor and prevents overtrading.
Action: Keep 20-30% of BTC holdings as untouchable "cold storage." Never trade this allocation. It's your floor.

**[Portfolio] #198: Multi-Timeframe Portfolio**
Edge: Running separate portfolios by timeframe (long-term hold, swing trading, day trading) prevents timeframe confusion and improves decision quality.
Action: Separate your capital: 60% long-term (rebalance quarterly), 30% swing (hold days-weeks), 10% active trading.

**[Portfolio] #199: Factor Exposure Management**
Edge: Crypto portfolios have hidden factor exposures (momentum, size, yield). Managing factors explicitly improves risk-adjusted returns by 15-20%.
Action: Identify your portfolio's factor tilts. If everything is high-momentum small-cap, you're concentrated in one factor regime.

**[Portfolio] #200: Exit Strategy Before Entry**
Edge: Defining exact exit conditions (target, stop, time stop) before entering improves execution by 25% and removes emotional decision-making.
Action: For every position, write down before entry: profit target, stop-loss level, time stop, and thesis invalidation criteria. No entry without an exit plan.
