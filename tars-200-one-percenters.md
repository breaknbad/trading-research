## #1–50: Timing & Core Macro

**1. Pre-FOMC Announcement Drift**
The S&P 500 averages +0.49% in the 24 hours before scheduled FOMC announcements, accounting for a disproportionate share of annual equity returns. This drift persists across decades and is attributed to investor positioning and hedging unwinds.
*Source: Lucca & Moench (2015), Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Report*
→ **Action:** Go long SPY at 2:00 PM the day before FOMC, exit at 2:15 PM on announcement day.

**2. Post-FOMC Volatility Reversal**
VIX typically drops 2-4 points in the 48 hours after FOMC regardless of decision direction, as uncertainty premium unwinds. The move is larger when VIX entered above 20.
*Source: CBOE historical data; Savor & Wilson (2013)*
→ **Action:** Sell VIX calls or buy short-dated SPY calls immediately after FOMC statement release.

**3. Turn-of-Month Effect (Last Day + First 4 Days)**
The last trading day of the month through the first four days of the next month captures roughly 70% of monthly S&P 500 returns. Driven by pension fund flows, 401(k) contributions, and institutional rebalancing.
*Source: Ariel (1987); Lakonishok & Smidt (1988)*
→ **Action:** Go long SPY on the last trading day of each month, hold through day 4 of the new month.

**4. CPI Release Day Volatility Regime**
Since 2021, CPI days generate average intraday SPY ranges of 1.8%, roughly 2× normal. The first 30-minute move reverses ~55% of the time by close.
*Source: Bloomberg data analysis; Cieslak, Morse & Vissing-Jorgensen (2019)*
→ **Action:** Fade the initial 30-minute CPI move with a stop at the day's extreme. Size at 0.5× normal.

**5. Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) Fade**
The initial 8:30 AM reaction to NFP reverses by noon ~60% of the time, particularly when the number deviates >1 standard deviation from consensus. The reversal is stronger on "good news is bad news" regimes.
*Source: Andersen, Bollerslev, Diebold & Vega (2003)*
→ **Action:** Wait 15 minutes post-NFP, then fade the move with a target of 50% retracement.

**6. 10:00 AM Reversal Window**
The 9:30–10:00 AM trend reverses at 10:00 AM roughly 65% of the time on non-event days, coinciding with economic data releases (ISM, JOLTS, etc.) and late institutional order flow.
*Source: Intraday pattern studies; Wood, McInish & Ord (1985)*
→ **Action:** On trend days that gap, wait for 10:00 AM. If reversal candle forms, enter counter-trend with stop at the 10 AM extreme.

**7. Power Hour (3:00–4:00 PM) Momentum**
The final hour accounts for ~30% of daily volume. Days trending by 3:00 PM continue in that direction into close ~70% of the time due to MOC imbalances and institutional execution.
*Source: NYSE MOC data; Cushing & Madhavan (2000)*
→ **Action:** At 3:00 PM, if SPY is trending with >60% of range in one direction, enter in trend direction targeting the close.

**8. Monday Reversal / Weekend Effect**
Mondays show negative average returns (-0.08%) vs. other days, especially following positive Fridays. The effect concentrates in the first 90 minutes as weekend risk premiums unwind.
*Source: French (1980); Gibbons & Hess (1981)*
→ **Action:** Fade bullish Friday gaps on Monday open. If SPY gaps up Monday after a strong Friday, short with a tight stop.

**9. Tuesday Reversal After Negative Monday**
When Monday closes down >0.5%, Tuesday shows positive returns ~62% of the time with an average gain of +0.3%. Likely institutional BTD behavior.
*Source: Cross-sectional day-of-week studies; Jaffe & Westerfield (1985)*
→ **Action:** If Monday closes down >0.5%, go long SPY at Tuesday open with a stop 0.5% below Monday's low.

**10. Wednesday FOMC Week Drift**
On FOMC weeks, Wednesday (pre-announcement) shows compressed ranges and upward drift as hedges are placed and shorts cover ahead of the 2:00 PM release.
*Source: Lucca & Moench (2015)*
→ **Action:** On FOMC Wednesdays, buy SPY at open, sell at 1:45 PM before announcement.

**11. Thursday Post-FOMC Continuation**
The day after FOMC tends to continue the post-announcement direction ~60% of the time, especially when the initial move was >1%. Lagged institutional repositioning drives this.
*Source: Bernanke & Kuttner (2005)*
→ **Action:** If FOMC day closes >1% in either direction, enter in that direction at Thursday's open.

**12. Friday Afternoon Drift Up**
Fridays 2:00–4:00 PM show a persistent upward bias (+0.05% average) as shorts cover ahead of weekend risk and portfolio managers window-dress.
*Source: Intraday seasonality literature; Harris (1986)*
→ **Action:** Go long SPY at 2:00 PM Friday if not in a clear downtrend. Small position, tight stop.

**13. OpEx Week (Monthly) Bullish Bias**
Monthly options expiration weeks (third Friday) show bullish bias in SPY ~58% of the time, driven by dealer gamma hedging and max-pain dynamics pulling price to high open interest strikes.
*Source: CBOE; Ni, Pearson & Poteshman (2005)*
→ **Action:** Go long SPY on Monday of OpEx week, exit Thursday close. Check max-pain level for target.

**14. OpEx Friday Pin Risk**
On expiration Friday, SPY gravitates toward the strike with highest open interest. The "pin" effect is strongest in the final 2 hours when gamma is highest.
*Source: Golez & Jackwerth (2012); Avellaneda & Lipkin (2003)*
→ **Action:** Identify the max-pain/highest OI strike. Sell straddles or strangles centered there on Thursday, close Friday at 3:30 PM.

**15. Quad Witching Volatility Spike**
Quarterly expiration (March, June, Sept, Dec third Friday) sees volume spike 30-50% above normal and average absolute returns of 0.8%. The final hour is especially volatile.
*Source: Stoll & Whaley (1987)*
→ **Action:** On quad witch days, widen stops 1.5×. Trade only the final hour if going directional, using MOC imbalance data.

**16. January Effect (Small-Cap Outperformance)**
Small caps (IWM) outperform large caps (SPY) by ~1.5% on average in January, driven by tax-loss selling unwind and new-year allocation flows.
*Source: Keim (1983); Rozeff & Kinney (1976)*
→ **Action:** Go long IWM / short SPY in late December, hold through January.

**17. Santa Claus Rally (Last 5 + First 2)**
The final 5 trading days of December through the first 2 of January average +1.3% for the S&P 500. Absence of a rally ("if Santa fails to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall") signals a weak Q1.
*Source: Stock Trader's Almanac; Hirsch (various years)*
→ **Action:** Go long SPY on Dec 24 close, hold through Jan 3. If rally fails, reduce Q1 equity exposure.

**18. Sell in May (Halloween Effect)**
November–April returns average ~+7% vs. May–October at ~+1.5% for the S&P 500. The effect is persistent globally across 100+ years of data.
*Source: Bouman & Jacobsen (2002), "The Halloween Indicator"*
→ **Action:** Increase equity exposure in November, rotate to defensive/cash in May. Not a hard rule—use as regime tilt.

**19. September Seasonality Weakness**
September is historically the worst month for the S&P 500, averaging -0.5% since 1950. Mutual fund tax-loss selling and Q3 institutional repositioning are cited drivers.
*Source: Stock Trader's Almanac; Jacobsen & Zhang (2013)*
→ **Action:** Reduce long exposure entering September, or add put protection in late August.

**20. Presidential Cycle Year 3 Strength**
Year 3 of the presidential cycle (e.g., 2027) averages +16% for the S&P 500—the strongest of the four years—driven by fiscal stimulus ahead of elections.
*Source: Hirsch, Stock Trader's Almanac; Booth & Booth (2003)*
→ **Action:** Increase equity allocation in Q4 of year 2 ahead of year 3 strength.

**21. Mid-Term Election Year Bottom**
In mid-term election years (year 2), the S&P 500 typically bottoms in Q3/early Q4, then rallies ~30% over the next 12 months. Every mid-term since 1942 has seen this pattern.
*Source: Hirsch; Stovall, CFRA (2022)*
→ **Action:** Aggressively buy dips in Q3 of mid-term years, hold 12 months.

**22. Rate Cut Cycle – First Cut Edge**
The S&P 500 averages +15% in the 12 months following the first Fed rate cut, but only when cutting outside of recession. In recession, the average is -5%.
*Source: Ned Davis Research; LPL Financial historical studies*
→ **Action:** Go long equities at first cut, BUT only if ISM >50 and unemployment <5%. If recession signals present, stay defensive.

**23. Rate Hike Cycle – Last Hike Edge**
After the final rate hike, the S&P 500 averages +13% over the subsequent 12 months. Equities front-run the pause.
*Source: Goldman Sachs, "After the Last Hike" (2023)*
→ **Action:** When the market prices the terminal rate, go long equities with 6-12 month horizon.

**24. Fed Funds Futures Mispricing**
Fed funds futures systematically overprice rate cuts and underprice hikes. When futures price >3 cuts in 12 months, the realized number averages 1.5.
*Source: Piazzesi & Swanson (2008)*
→ **Action:** When market prices extreme dovishness, buy financials (XLF) and sell duration (TLT puts).

**25. VIX Mean Reversion from >30**
When VIX spikes above 30, it reverts below 25 within 20 trading days ~80% of the time. The median return for SPY over those 20 days is +4.2%.
*Source: CBOE; Whaley (2009)*
→ **Action:** When VIX hits 30+, start scaling into SPY longs over 3-5 days. Sell VIX call spreads.

**26. VIX Contango Steepness Signal**
When the VIX futures term structure contango exceeds 10% (M2/M1), spot VIX tends to stay low and equities grind higher. Backwardation (inverted) signals elevated risk.
*Source: VIX Central; Mixon (2007)*
→ **Action:** Monitor VIX M1/M2 ratio daily. Contango >10% = stay long. Backwardation = reduce exposure and buy puts.

**27. VIX Under 13 – Complacency Warning**
VIX below 13 has preceded 5%+ corrections within 3 months in 7 of the last 10 instances. Low vol breeds high vol.
*Source: CBOE historical data*
→ **Action:** When VIX drops below 13, buy 30-45 DTE SPY puts as portfolio hedges (spend 0.5% of portfolio).

**28. VVIX (Vol-of-Vol) Divergence**
When VVIX spikes above 120 while VIX stays below 20, a VIX explosion (and equity sell-off) typically follows within 5-10 trading days ~65% of the time.
*Source: CBOE VVIX data*
→ **Action:** Monitor VVIX/VIX ratio. When VVIX >120 and VIX <20, buy VIX calls or SPY put spreads.

**29. 2-Year Treasury Yield as Fed Predictor**
The 2Y yield leads Fed policy by ~6 months. When 2Y drops 50bps below fed funds, the Fed cuts within 6 months ~85% of the time.
*Source: Fed historical data; Gürkaynak, Sack & Swanson (2005)*
→ **Action:** Track 2Y vs FFR spread. Widening negative spread = position for rate-sensitive sectors (XLU, XLRE, TLT).

**30. 10Y-2Y Yield Curve Inversion Signal**
Every recession since 1955 was preceded by 10Y-2Y inversion. The median lag is 17 months. Un-inversion (re-steepening) is the proximate recession signal.
*Source: Campbell Harvey (1986); Estrella & Mishkin (1998)*
→ **Action:** After sustained inversion, when the curve re-steepens, shift to defensive: XLU, XLP, TLT, cash. The recession is near.

**31. 10Y-3M Spread – Sahm Rule Companion**
The 10Y-3M spread has a perfect recession-prediction record since 1960. When it re-steepens after inversion AND unemployment rises 0.5% from its 12-month low (Sahm Rule), recession is imminent.
*Source: Sahm (2019); Estrella & Trubin (2006)*
→ **Action:** Monitor both indicators simultaneously. When both trigger, go maximum defensive: 50% cash, 30% TLT, 20% XLP.

**32. ISM Manufacturing PMI Below 50 – Equity Implications**
When ISM manufacturing drops below 50 (contraction), the S&P 500 returns average +2% over the next 6 months—counterintuitively—because markets front-run the recovery. Below 45 is different: average return is -5%.
*Source: ISM; Fama & French factor data*
→ **Action:** ISM 45-50 = buy dips. ISM <45 = stay defensive. Track the rate of change, not just the level.

**33. Chicago Fed National Activity Index (CFNAI) Signal**
When the 3-month moving average of CFNAI drops below -0.7, a recession has started or is imminent. This indicator has an 85% accuracy rate since 1967.
*Source: Chicago Fed; Evans, Liu & Pham (2002)*
→ **Action:** Add CFNAI to weekly dashboard. Below -0.7 = reduce equity exposure by 50%.

**34. Leading Economic Index (LEI) Decline Rate**
When the Conference Board LEI declines >2% over 6 months with negative diffusion, recession probability exceeds 70%.
*Source: Conference Board; Diebold & Rudebusch (1989)*
→ **Action:** Track LEI monthly. Sustained declines = underweight equities, overweight Treasuries.

**35. Initial Jobless Claims Trend**
When the 4-week moving average of initial claims rises >15% from its cycle low, equity markets enter a higher-risk regime. Every recession since 1967 was preceded by this signal.
*Source: DOL; Brave, Butters & Kelley (2019)*
→ **Action:** Monitor weekly claims data. Trend deterioration = add protective puts, reduce cyclical exposure.

**36. Consumer Confidence – Extreme Readings**
Conference Board Consumer Confidence above 140 precedes equity corrections ~70% of the time within 6 months. Below 60 precedes rallies ~75% of the time.
*Source: Conference Board; Fisher & Statman (2003)*
→ **Action:** Extreme high confidence = trim longs. Extreme low confidence = add to equity positions.

**37. University of Michigan Sentiment as Contrarian Signal**
UMich Consumer Sentiment in the bottom decile historically precedes 12-month SPY returns of +15% on average. The crowd is maximally bearish near bottoms.
*Source: University of Michigan; Brown & Cliff (2005)*
→ **Action:** When UMich drops to bottom decile, initiate long equity positions. Dollar-cost average over 4 weeks.

**38. AAII Sentiment Survey Extremes**
When AAII Bears exceed 50%, forward 6-month S&P 500 returns average +11%. When Bulls exceed 55%, forward returns average +2%.
*Source: AAII; Fisher & Statman (2000)*
→ **Action:** Check AAII weekly. Bears >50% = scale into longs. Bulls >55% = tighten stops and reduce new positions.

**39. Put/Call Ratio Extremes**
CBOE equity put/call ratio >1.0 (10-day MA) precedes 1-month SPY rallies of +2.5% on average. Below 0.6 precedes weakness.
*Source: CBOE; Bandopadhyaya & Jones (2008)*
→ **Action:** Track 10-day MA of P/C ratio. Extreme fear (>1.0) = buy. Extreme greed (<0.6) = hedge.

**40. NAAIM Exposure Index**
When NAAIM (active manager exposure) drops below 25, forward 8-week SPY returns average +4.5%. Above 100, forward returns average +0.5%.
*Source: NAAIM*
→ **Action:** Use NAAIM as a positioning indicator. Low readings = buy. Extremely high readings = hedge.

**41. Fed Balance Sheet Changes**
Quantitative tightening (QT) at >$60B/month drags liquidity and correlates with higher equity vol. QE periods see VIX compressed and equities bid.
*Source: Fed H.4.1 data; Krishnamurthy & Vissing-Jorgensen (2011)*
→ **Action:** Track monthly Fed balance sheet changes. Acceleration of QT = reduce exposure. QE restart = go aggressively long.

**42. Reverse Repo (RRP) Facility Drain**
As the RRP drains, liquidity flows into risk assets. The S&P 500 rallied ~15% during the 2023 RRP drawdown from $2.5T to <$1T.
*Source: NY Fed RRP data*
→ **Action:** Monitor RRP weekly. Rapid draining = liquidity tailwind for equities. Rapid filling = tightening signal.

**43. Treasury General Account (TGA) Rebuilds**
When Treasury rebuilds the TGA (post-debt ceiling), it drains ~$200-500B from markets over 2-3 months, acting as de facto tightening.
*Source: Treasury.gov; Duffie (2020)*
→ **Action:** After debt ceiling resolutions, expect TGA rebuild. Reduce equity exposure for 2-3 months during the drain.

**44. Dollar (DXY) Regime – Equity Correlation**
When DXY rises >5% in 3 months, S&P 500 multinational earnings face headwinds. DXY above 105 historically pressures EM and commodity stocks.
*Source: Bloomberg; Hau & Rey (2006)*
→ **Action:** Strong dollar environment = overweight domestic small caps (IWM) vs. multinationals. Underweight EM (EEM).

**45. Dollar Smile Theory Application**
The dollar strengthens in both risk-off (flight to safety) and strong US growth regimes, but weakens when global growth is synchronized. Position accordingly.
*Source: Stephen Jen, "Dollar Smile" (2001)*
→ **Action:** Assess regime: risk-off dollar strength = be in TLT + gold. Growth dollar strength = be in US cyclicals. Dollar weakness = be in EEM and commodities.

**46. Gold-to-SPY Ratio as Risk Barometer**
When the GLD/SPY ratio rises >15% in 3 months, it signals risk-off rotation. This preceded the 2020 crash, 2022 drawdown, and 2008 crisis.
*Source: Baur & Lucey (2010)*
→ **Action:** Track GLD/SPY ratio. Rapid rise = reduce equity beta, add gold and Treasuries.

**47. Copper/Gold Ratio as Growth Proxy**
The copper/gold ratio correlates ~0.8 with the 10Y yield and is a real-time proxy for global growth expectations. Falling ratio = slowing growth.
*Source: Gundlach, DoubleLine presentations*
→ **Action:** Falling copper/gold = underweight cyclicals, overweight defensives. Rising = overweight cyclicals.

**48. Oil Price Shock Threshold**
When crude oil rises >50% in 6 months, the probability of recession within 12 months rises to ~45%. The demand destruction effect lags 6-9 months.
*Source: Hamilton (1983, 2003)*
→ **Action:** After a 50%+ oil spike, begin reducing cyclical exposure 3 months later. Add XLE as a hedge during the rise.

**49. Breakeven Inflation Rates as Positioning Signal**
When 5Y5Y forward breakevens rise above 2.5%, the Fed tightening cycle intensifies. Below 2.0% signals deflation risk and potential easing.
*Source: FRED; Haubrich, Pennacchi & Ritchken (2012)*
→ **Action:** Breakevens >2.5% = short TLT, long TIPS, long commodities. Below 2.0% = long TLT, long growth stocks.

**50. High-Frequency Macro Surprise Index**
When the Citi Economic Surprise Index drops below -50, it tends to mean-revert. SPY forward 3-month returns average +4% from those levels.
*Source: Citigroup; Scotti (2016)*
→ **Action:** CESI below -50 = economic data has been disappointing, but improvement is likely. Go long cyclicals.

## #51–100: Sector, Economic Releases & Market Breadth

**51. Sector Rotation by Rate Cycle – Early Easing**
In early rate-cutting cycles, rate-sensitive sectors outperform: XLU (+12% avg), XLRE (+10%), XLK (+9%) in the 6 months following the first cut.
*Source: Fidelity Sector Rotation studies; Stangl, Jacobsen & Visaltanachoti (2009)*
→ **Action:** At first rate cut, overweight XLU, XLRE, XLK. Underweight XLE, XLF.

**52. Sector Rotation by Rate Cycle – Late Hiking**
In the final 3 months of a hiking cycle, XLE (+8%) and XLF (+6%) outperform as the economy is still strong but peak rates are near.
*Source: Ned Davis Research*
→ **Action:** When market prices the terminal rate, rotate into XLE and XLF.

**53. Yield Curve Steepening – Bank Outperformance**
When the 2s10s curve steepens >50bps in 3 months, KBE (bank ETF) outperforms SPY by ~5% over the next 6 months. Net interest margin expansion drives earnings.
*Source: Adrian, Estrella & Shin (2019)*
→ **Action:** Buy KBE on curve steepening signals. Target 2-3 month hold.

**54. Yield Curve Flattening – Utility & Staples Bid**
Aggressive curve flattening favors XLU and XLP, which outperform by 3-5% in the 6 months following >50bps flattening.
*Source: Becker & Ivashina (2015)*
→ **Action:** Flattening curve = rotate to XLU, XLP. Reduce cyclical (XLI, XLB) exposure.

**55. ISM Manufacturing – New Orders Component**
The ISM New Orders sub-index leads the headline by 2-3 months and the S&P 500 by 3-6 months. A cross above 52 from below signals equity upside of ~8% over 6 months.
*Source: ISM; Banbura, Giannone & Reichlin (2010)*
→ **Action:** Track ISM New Orders monthly. Cross above 52 from below = go long SPY and XLI.

**56. ISM Services (NMI) Equity Signal**
ISM Services >55 correlates with S&P 500 EPS growth >8%. Below 50, earnings growth typically goes negative within 2 quarters.
*Source: ISM; Markit*
→ **Action:** ISM Services >55 = overweight services-exposed names. Below 50 = reduce consumer discretionary (XLY).

**57. PMI-to-Equity Momentum Lag**
Global PMI (JP Morgan/S&P) turns precede equity market turns by 1-3 months. The correlation between PMI acceleration and forward equity returns is ~0.6.
*Source: JP Morgan Global PMI; Camacho & Perez-Quiros (2010)*
→ **Action:** When global PMI inflects upward, go long international (EFA, EEM) and cyclicals.

**58. Housing Starts as Cyclical Indicator**
Housing starts lead GDP by 2-3 quarters. When starts decline >15% YoY, a growth slowdown follows. XHB (homebuilder ETF) leads the housing data by 3-6 months.
*Source: Leamer (2007), "Housing IS the Business Cycle"*
→ **Action:** Watch XHB for signals. If XHB breaks down, expect housing data to weaken and position defensively.

**59. Existing Home Sales – Wealth Effect Proxy**
Existing home sales correlate 0.7 with consumer confidence. A 3-month decline >10% typically precedes consumer spending weakness.
*Source: NAR; Case, Quigley & Shiller (2005)*
→ **Action:** Falling home sales = underweight XLY, XRT (retail). Overweight XLP.

**60. New Home Sales as Leading Indicator**
New home sales lead existing home sales by 3-6 months and lead GDP by 4-6 quarters. It's one of the most forward-looking economic indicators.
*Source: Conference Board LEI methodology*
→ **Action:** Track new home sales monthly. Inflection up = go long XHB, HD, LOW.

**61. Retail Sales – Control Group Focus**
The "control group" (ex-autos, gas, building materials, food) feeds directly into GDP. A miss of >0.3% below consensus typically moves SPY -0.3% on release day.
*Source: Census Bureau; Croushore (2011)*
→ **Action:** Trade the control group, not the headline. Beat = long XLY day of release. Miss = long XLP.

**62. Durable Goods – Core Capital Orders**
Non-defense capital goods ex-aircraft (core capex) leads business investment by 2 quarters. Three consecutive monthly declines signal capex recession.
*Source: Census Bureau; Oliner, Sichel & Stiroh (2007)*
→ **Action:** Track core capex orders. Deterioration = underweight XLI (industrials). Improvement = overweight XLI.

**63. PCE Deflator – Fed's Preferred Inflation Gauge**
Core PCE is the Fed's target variable. When trailing 3-month annualized core PCE drops below 2.5%, the path to cuts opens. Above 3.5% = more hikes.
*Source: BEA; Bernanke (2004)*
→ **Action:** Track 3-month annualized core PCE. Dropping toward 2% = long TLT and growth stocks. Rising = short TLT, long value.

**64. PPI as CPI Leading Indicator**
PPI (final demand) leads CPI by 1-2 months. PPI surprises in the same direction predict CPI surprises ~65% of the time.
*Source: BLS; Clark (1995)*
→ **Action:** Use PPI release to position ahead of CPI. PPI hot = buy CPI day puts. PPI cool = buy CPI day calls.

**65. Import Prices as Goods Inflation Proxy**
Import price index leads goods CPI by 1-2 months due to supply chain lags. A 5%+ YoY rise in import prices forecasts sticky goods inflation.
*Source: BLS; Marazzi & Sheets (2007)*
→ **Action:** Rising import prices = long TIPS, short TLT. Falling = long TLT, long growth.

**66. Unit Labor Costs as Inflation Persistence Gauge**
ULC rising >4% YoY historically keeps the Fed hawkish. Correlates with sustained core inflation above target 80% of the time.
*Source: BLS; Gordon (1998)*
→ **Action:** ULC >4% = expect higher-for-longer rates. Overweight financials (XLF), underweight long-duration equities.

**67. Advance/Decline Line Divergence**
When SPY makes a new high but the NYSE A/D line does not confirm (lower high), the subsequent 3-month drawdown averages -5.5%. This divergence preceded 2007, 2018, and 2021 corrections.
*Source: Zweig (1986); Lowry Research*
→ **Action:** Track NYSE A/D line vs. SPY daily. Divergence = tighten stops, add put protection.

**68. New Highs – New Lows Index**
When new 52-week highs exceed new lows by >10:1, the market is in a strong uptrend. When new lows exceed highs, risk is elevated.
*Source: Fosback (1976); Lowry Research*
→ **Action:** NH-NL ratio >10:1 = stay long, buy dips. Ratio inverting = reduce exposure.

**69. McClellan Oscillator Extremes**
McClellan Oscillator below -150 precedes 1-month SPY rallies of +3.5% on average (oversold bounce). Above +150 signals short-term exhaustion.
*Source: McClellan Financial Publications*
→ **Action:** McClellan <-150 = buy SPY for a 2-4 week hold. >+150 = take profits on longs.

**70. McClellan Summation Index Trend**
When the McClellan Summation Index crosses above zero from below, it signals a new intermediate uptrend. Below zero = bearish intermediate trend. Signal reliability is ~70%.
*Source: McClellan Financial Publications; Appel (2005)*
→ **Action:** Summation Index crossing above zero = increase equity exposure. Crossing below = reduce.

**71. Percentage of Stocks Above 200-Day MA**
When >80% of S&P 500 stocks are above their 200-day MA, the market is in a broad uptrend. Drops below 30% signal capitulation/bottoming. The sweet spot for buying is the recovery from below 30% back above.
*Source: StockCharts; Coppock (1962)*
→ **Action:** <30% and rising = aggressive buy. >80% = strong trend, stay long but tighten stops.

**72. Percentage of Stocks Above 50-Day MA – Thrust Signal**
When the % above 50-day MA surges from below 25% to above 75% within 30 days (breadth thrust), forward 12-month returns average +22%.
*Source: Zweig (1986); Walter Deemer breadth thrust data*
→ **Action:** Breadth thrust trigger = go maximum long. These signals are rare (1-2 per cycle) and extremely reliable.

**73. Hindenburg Omen**
Triggered when new highs and new lows both exceed 2.8% of advances+declines, with McClellan Oscillator negative. Precedes 5%+ declines ~40% of the time within 4 months.
*Source: Jim Miekka (1995)*
→ **Action:** Hindenburg Omen alone is unreliable. Use as confirmation with other bearish signals (A/D divergence, VIX rising).

**74. Credit Spread Widening – HYG vs LQD**
When HYG-LQD spread widens >100bps in 1 month, equity corrections of >5% follow ~70% of the time within 2 months. Credit leads equities.
*Source: Gilchrist & Zakrajsek (2012)*
→ **Action:** Monitor HYG/LQD ratio daily. Rapid deterioration = reduce equity exposure, add put protection.

**75. High Yield OAS – Absolute Level Signal**
When ICE BofA HY OAS exceeds 500bps, forward 12-month HYG returns average +15% and SPY returns average +12%. Below 300bps = overvalued, risk is elevated.
*Source: ICE BofA; Altman & Kishore (1998)*
→ **Action:** HY OAS >500 = buy risk assets (SPY, HYG). <300 = reduce credit and equity exposure.

**76. Investment Grade Spread Divergence from HY**
When IG spreads are stable but HY widens, it signals idiosyncratic stress in lower-quality credits. When both widen, systemic stress is building.
*Source: Collin-Dufresne, Goldstein & Martin (2001)*
→ **Action:** HY-only widening = avoid CCC-rated names but stay in equities. Both widening = go defensive.

**77. CDX Investment Grade Index as Risk Thermometer**
CDX IG above 80bps historically correlates with SPY drawdowns. Below 55bps = complacency. The CDX moves 1-3 days before equity vol spikes.
*Source: Markit; Longstaff, Mithal & Neis (2005)*
→ **Action:** CDX IG rising above 80 = buy SPY puts. Add as a daily dashboard item.

**78. Treasury Auction Demand (Bid-to-Cover)**
When 10Y Treasury auction bid-to-cover drops below 2.2×, yields rise and equities face headwinds. Strong auctions (>2.6×) support risk assets.
*Source: Treasury Direct; Goldreich (2007)*
→ **Action:** Track auction results (Tues/Wed/Thurs cycle). Weak auction = short TLT, expect equity pressure.

**79. Treasury Auction Tail**
When auctions "tail" (high yield >2bps above when-issued), it signals weak demand. Back-to-back tails in 10Y and 30Y preceded the Oct 2023 equity correction.
*Source: Treasury data; Lou, Yan & Zhang (2013)*
→ **Action:** Auction tail >2bps = expect rate pressure. Reduce duration and growth stock exposure.

**80. Foreign Central Bank Treasury Demand**
When foreign official holdings decline >5% in the TIC data, it signals reduced demand for US Treasuries and upward rate pressure. This pressures equity valuations.
*Source: Treasury International Capital (TIC) data*
→ **Action:** Monitor TIC monthly. Declining foreign demand = rising term premium = underweight long-duration equities.

**81. Bank Lending Standards (SLOOS)**
The Fed's Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey (SLOOS) showing net tightening >20% correlates with economic slowdown within 2-4 quarters. Equities typically peak 6-9 months after tightening begins.
*Source: Federal Reserve SLOOS; Lown & Morgan (2006)*
→ **Action:** Significant tightening in SLOOS = reduce cyclical equity exposure within 6 months.

**82. Financial Conditions Index (FCI)**
When the Goldman Sachs or Chicago Fed FCI tightens rapidly (>1 standard deviation in 3 months), equity corrections of >5% follow ~65% of the time.
*Source: Hatzius, Hooper & Mishkin (2010)*
→ **Action:** Track FCI weekly. Rapid tightening = defensive positioning. Easing = risk-on.

**83. S&P 500 EPS Revision Breadth**
When the 3-month EPS revision breadth (upgrades minus downgrades / total) exceeds +10%, forward 3-month SPY returns average +3.5%. Below -10%, returns average -2%.
*Source: FactSet Earnings Insight*
→ **Action:** Track earnings revision breadth on FactSet/Bloomberg. Positive = stay long. Negative = reduce exposure.

**84. Energy Sector (XLE) as Inflation Hedge**
XLE outperforms SPY by 5-15% in quarters where CPI runs above 4%. The correlation between energy and inflation is ~0.7.
*Source: Bloomberg; Gorton & Rouwenhorst (2006)*
→ **Action:** In inflationary regimes (CPI >3.5%), allocate 10-15% of portfolio to XLE.

**85. Utilities (XLU) as Bond Proxy / Rate Play**
XLU has a -0.65 correlation with 10Y yields. When 10Y drops >50bps in a month, XLU averages +5% in the following month.
*Source: Boudoukh, Richardson & Whitelaw (1994)*
→ **Action:** Falling rates = buy XLU. Rising rates rapidly = sell XLU.

**86. Healthcare (XLV) as Defensive Allocation**
XLV has a beta of ~0.65 and outperforms SPY by 3-4% during corrections >10%. It's the best risk-adjusted defensive sector.
*Source: Fama-French sector regressions*
→ **Action:** In uncertain regimes, overweight XLV as a defensive equity allocation. Lower beta, similar returns.

**87. Technology (XLK) – Duration Sensitivity**
XLK's correlation with the 10Y yield shifted to -0.5 since 2020 (from near-zero historically). Tech sells off ~2× faster than SPY during rate spikes.
*Source: Bloomberg; Dechow, Sloan & Soliman (2004)*
→ **Action:** In rising rate environments, reduce XLK allocation. In falling rate environments, overweight XLK.

**88. Financials (XLF) – Rate Regime Dependence**
XLF outperforms when rates are rising moderately (25-50bps/quarter) but underperforms when rates spike or in inversions. The ideal regime is a steepening curve with rates between 3-5%.
*Source: English, Van den Heuvel & Zakrajsek (2018)*
→ **Action:** Monitor curve shape and rate-of-change of rates. Moderate rise + steepening = long XLF.

**89. Consumer Discretionary (XLY) – Jobs Market Lead**
XLY relative performance leads the unemployment rate by ~6 months. When XLY/XLP ratio breaks down, expect labor market weakness.
*Source: Stovall, S&P CFRA*
→ **Action:** Track XLY/XLP ratio. Breakdown = position for slowing economy. Breakout = position for growth.

**90. Real Estate (XLRE) – Rate Sensitivity Champion**
XLRE is the most rate-sensitive equity sector, with a -0.8 correlation to 10Y yields over 3-month periods. It leads in early easing cycles.
*Source: Ling & Naranjo (1997)*
→ **Action:** First rate cut = buy XLRE. Rate hike cycle = avoid or short XLRE.

**91. Materials (XLB) – China PMI Proxy**
XLB has a 0.6 correlation with China Caixin Manufacturing PMI. When China PMI rises above 50, XLB outperforms SPY by ~4% over 3 months.
*Source: Bloomberg; Fernald, Hsu & Spiegel (2021)*
→ **Action:** Track China PMI. Expansion = long XLB. Contraction = avoid.

**92. Industrials (XLI) – ISM Manufacturing Beta**
XLI/SPY ratio tracks ISM Manufacturing with a 0.75 correlation. XLI outperforms by ~6% in the 6 months following ISM crossing above 50.
*Source: ISM data; Fama-French industry portfolios*
→ **Action:** ISM rising through 50 = buy XLI. Below 48 and falling = underweight.

**93. Small Cap (IWM) – Liquidity Beta**
IWM outperforms SPY by 5-10% in the 6 months following the start of Fed easing cycles. Small caps are more credit-sensitive and benefit most from loosening conditions.
*Source: Perez-Quiros & Timmermann (2000)*
→ **Action:** Rate cuts beginning = overweight IWM. QT acceleration = underweight IWM.

**94. Growth vs. Value Rotation – Real Rate Signal**
When 10Y real rates (TIPS yield) rise above 1.5%, value (IVE) outperforms growth (IVW) by ~3% per quarter. Below 0%, growth dominates.
*Source: Asness, Moskowitz & Pedersen (2013)*
→ **Action:** Track 10Y TIPS yield. >1.5% = overweight value. <0% = overweight growth.

**95. S&P 500 Equal-Weight vs. Cap-Weight Divergence**
When RSP (equal-weight) underperforms SPY (cap-weight) by >5% over 3 months, concentration risk is elevated. This narrow leadership eventually reverses.
*Source: DeMiguel, Garlappi & Uppal (2009)*
→ **Action:** Track RSP/SPY ratio. Large divergence = the rally is fragile. Consider rotating from mega-cap to equal-weight.

**96. Regional Fed Surveys as PMI Preview**
Empire State (NY), Philly Fed, and Dallas Fed manufacturing surveys collectively predict ISM with ~0.8 correlation. They release 1-2 weeks before ISM.
*Source: Federal Reserve; Aruoba & Diebold (2010)*
→ **Action:** Trade ISM expectations based on regional surveys. 2+ regional surveys beating = go long XLI before ISM release.

**97. Jobless Claims 4-Week Trend as Equity Signal**
When the 4-week MA of initial claims falls below 220K, equity markets are in a bullish regime. Above 280K, bear market risk is elevated.
*Source: DOL; Stock & Watson (1989)*
→ **Action:** Below 220K = aggressive equity longs. Above 280K = heavy hedging, defensive posture.

**98. Job Openings (JOLTS) – Vacancy/Unemployment Ratio**
The V/U ratio (vacancies per unemployed) above 1.5 signals a very tight labor market = hawkish Fed. Below 0.8 signals recession.
*Source: BLS JOLTS; Barnichon & Figura (2015)*
→ **Action:** V/U falling from elevated levels = Fed approaching dovish pivot. Pre-position for rate-sensitive outperformance.

**99. Atlanta Fed GDPNow vs. Blue Chip Consensus**
When GDPNow deviates >1.5% from Blue Chip consensus, the market tends to re-price toward GDPNow. It's more accurate within-quarter.
*Source: Atlanta Fed; Higgins (2014)*
→ **Action:** When GDPNow is substantially higher than consensus, go long cyclicals. When lower, reduce exposure.

**100. Beige Book Sentiment Analysis**
Counting positive/negative language in the Beige Book using NLP predicts GDP direction with ~70% accuracy. Key words: "strong," "moderate," "slowed."
*Source: Federal Reserve Beige Book; Balke & Petersen (2002)*
→ **Action:** Read Beige Book for tone shifts. Deteriorating language = expect dovish Fed minutes/statement.

## #101–150: ETF Mechanics, Earnings, Volatility & Systematic Flows

**101. ETF Creation/Redemption Arbitrage – Premium/Discount**
When ETFs trade at >0.5% premium to NAV, authorized participants create shares (selling pressure coming). At >0.5% discount, redemptions signal stress or forced selling.
*Source: Petajisto (2017); Ben-David, Franzoni & Moussawi (2018)*
→ **Action:** Monitor HYG, LQD, and EM ETF premiums/discounts. Persistent discounts = credit stress brewing.

**102. ETF Flow Momentum**
ETFs receiving >$1B weekly inflows outperform peers by ~1% over the next month. Momentum in flows persists 2-4 weeks.
*Source: ICI; Da & Shive (2018)*
→ **Action:** Track top ETF inflows weekly (etf.com). Ride the flow momentum with 2-4 week holding period.

**103. Sector ETF Relative Strength Rotation**
Sector ETFs showing 1-month RSI >70 relative to SPY continue to outperform for ~2 more weeks before mean-reverting. Below RSI 30 reverts upward within 2 weeks.
*Source: Jegadeesh & Titman (1993); Moskowitz & Grinblatt (1999)*
→ **Action:** Use 1-month sector RSI for momentum. RSI >70 = ride for 2 more weeks. RSI <30 = buy for mean reversion.

**104. Leveraged ETF Decay / Volatility Drag**
3× leveraged ETFs (TQQQ, SOXL) lose ~5-10% annually to volatility drag in choppy markets. In trending markets, they outperform 3× due to compounding.
*Source: Cheng & Madhavan (2009)*
→ **Action:** Only use leveraged ETFs in strong trending environments (20-day MA rising). Never hold through choppy ranges.

**105. Leveraged ETF Rebalancing Flow**
Leveraged ETFs rebalance daily at 3:45-4:00 PM. On big move days (SPY >1.5%), the rebalancing flows can add 0.2-0.5% to the close in the trending direction.
*Source: Cheng & Madhavan (2009); Trainor (2010)*
→ **Action:** On days with SPY >1.5% move, go with the trend at 3:40 PM for a 20-minute trade targeting the leveraged ETF rebalance flow.

**106. Bond ETF Duration Mismatch Signal**
When TLT trades at a persistent discount while AGG is at par, it signals long-duration aversion. This preceded the 2022-23 rate shock by weeks.
*Source: Pan & Zeng (2019)*
→ **Action:** TLT discount widening = expect more rate pressure. Reduce duration exposure across equities and bonds.

**107. Earnings Season Macro Effect – Beat Rate**
When the S&P 500 earnings beat rate exceeds 75% (the norm), it adds ~1.5% to SPY during earnings season. Below 65%, SPY typically drops 2-3%.
*Source: FactSet Earnings Insight; Livnat & Mendenhall (2006)*
→ **Action:** Track weekly beat rate during earnings season. Above 75% = stay long. Below 65% = hedge.

**108. Earnings Season Volatility Compression**
VIX typically drops 2-3 points during weeks 2-4 of earnings season as idiosyncratic vol replaces systematic risk. The compression is tradeable.
*Source: Dubinsky & Johannes (2006)*
→ **Action:** Sell VIX call spreads or short UVXY in weeks 2-4 of earnings season.

**109. Pre-Earnings Announcement Drift**
Stocks with positive earnings momentum drift up ~1.5% in the 30 days before earnings. The effect is strongest for stocks with 3+ consecutive beats.
*Source: Chan, Jegadeesh & Lakonishok (1996)*
→ **Action:** Buy stocks with strong revision trends 30 days before earnings. Sell before announcement to avoid event risk.

**110. Post-Earnings Announcement Drift (PEAD)**
Stocks that beat estimates by >10% continue to outperform by ~2% over the next 60 days. Misses by >10% continue to underperform by ~3%.
*Source: Ball & Brown (1968); Bernard & Thomas (1989)*
→ **Action:** Buy large beat stocks 1-2 days post-earnings for a 2-month hold. Short large miss stocks.

**111. Earnings Guidance Impact > Beat/Miss**
Guidance changes move stocks 2-3× more than beat/miss magnitude. Upward guidance revision averages +4% next-day move; downward averages -6%.
*Source: Anilowski, Feng & Skinner (2007)*
→ **Action:** Focus on guidance, not the beat. Enter positions post-guidance, not pre-earnings.

**112. Mega-Cap Earnings as Market Signal**
When AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL collectively beat and guide up, SPY averages +2% in the following 2 weeks. Collective misses precede -3% moves.
*Source: Market observation; Hou & Robinson (2006)*
→ **Action:** Trade SPY after mega-cap earnings week. All beat = add longs. Significant misses = hedge.

**113. VIX Term Structure – Contango Roll Yield**
Short VIX strategies (like selling VIX futures) earn ~3-5% monthly roll yield in normal contango. This edge disappears in backwardation.
*Source: Alexander & Korovilas (2013)*
→ **Action:** In contango: sell VIX front month, buy VIX second month (calendar spread). Exit in backwardation.

**114. VIX of VIX (VVIX) as Tail Risk Indicator**
VVIX above 140 preceded the Feb 2018 Volmageddon, March 2020 crash, and Aug 2024 yen carry unwind. It signals that tail risk pricing is extreme.
*Source: CBOE; Park (2015)*
→ **Action:** VVIX >140 = buy far OTM SPY puts as tail hedges. Costs are justified by the magnitude of potential moves.

**115. Volatility Surface – Skew as Directional Signal**
When 25-delta put IV exceeds 25-delta call IV by >8 vol points (steep skew), protective put demand is extreme and a bounce is likely within 5 days ~60% of the time.
*Source: Bollen & Whaley (2004); Xing, Zhang & Zhao (2010)*
→ **Action:** Extreme put skew = sell put spreads or buy calls. Mean reversion in skew profits.

**116. Volatility Surface – Flat Skew as Complacency**
When skew flattens (put-call IV differential <3 points), protection is cheap and should be bought. Flat skew preceded the Feb 2018 and Sept 2018 selloffs.
*Source: CBOE Skew Index*
→ **Action:** Flat skew = protection is cheap. Buy 30-45 DTE 5% OTM puts.

**117. CBOE Skew Index Extreme Readings**
CBOE SKEW above 150 signals elevated tail risk pricing. Above 160 has preceded 5%+ corrections ~50% of the time within 30 days.
*Source: CBOE*
→ **Action:** SKEW >150 = respect the signal. Add put protection and reduce position sizes.

**118. Implied vs. Realized Volatility Spread**
When SPY implied vol exceeds realized vol by >5 points (the "volatility risk premium"), selling options is profitable ~75% of the time.
*Source: Carr & Wu (2009); Coval & Shumway (2001)*
→ **Action:** Track IV-RV spread. When premium is >5 points, sell iron condors or credit spreads. When premium is <2 points, buy options.

**119. Gamma Exposure (GEX) – Dealer Positioning**
When aggregate dealer gamma exposure is highly positive (>$5B), dealers buy dips and sell rallies, suppressing volatility. Negative GEX amplifies moves in both directions.
*Source: Squeezemetrics; Barbon & Buraschi (2021)*
→ **Action:** Track GEX (Squeezemetrics or SpotGamma). Positive GEX = sell vol, buy dips. Negative GEX = widen stops, reduce position sizes.

**120. Delta Exposure (DEX) – Directional Pressure**
When dealer delta exposure is very negative, dealers must buy as prices rise (fueling rallies) and sell as they fall (amplifying selloffs). This creates reflexive moves.
*Source: Squeezemetrics*
→ **Action:** Negative DEX with rising market = momentum chase. Negative DEX with falling market = gap risk, be cautious.

**121. 0DTE Options Impact on Intraday Volatility**
Since 2022, 0DTE options account for ~45% of SPY options volume, creating new intraday volatility patterns. Gamma pinning is stronger near high-OI strikes intraday.
*Source: CBOE; Boyarchenko, Gupta & Yin (2023)*
→ **Action:** Identify highest 0DTE open interest strikes as intraday support/resistance. Price gravitates toward these levels.

**122. CTA (Trend-Following) Positioning Estimates**
When estimated CTA equity exposure exceeds 90th percentile, crowded positioning creates reversal risk. CTAs unwind in ~2 weeks when trends break.
*Source: Goldman Sachs; Hamill, Rattray & Van Hemert (2016)*
→ **Action:** Track CTA positioning estimates (GS, JPM reports). Extreme long = risk of crowded exit. Extreme short = fuel for short squeeze.

**123. CTA Trigger Levels – Systematic Flows**
CTAs follow lookback windows (10d, 1m, 3m, 6m, 12m). When price crosses the 50-day or 200-day MA, systematic CTA flows typically add $15-30B in equities over 2-3 weeks.
*Source: Société Générale CTA flow model; Baltas & Kosowski (2013)*
→ **Action:** Watch key MA crossovers (50/200-day on SPX). Cross above = CTA buying wave coming. Cross below = selling wave.

**124. Risk Parity Rebalancing Signals**
Risk parity funds (Bridgewater, AQR) rebalance when equity vol rises, selling equities and buying bonds. A 30%+ VIX spike triggers ~$20-40B in equity selling over 1-2 weeks.
*Source: Asness, Frazzini & Pedersen (2012)*
→ **Action:** After VIX spikes >30%, expect risk parity selling pressure for 1-2 weeks. Don't bottom-fish too early.

**125. Volatility Targeting Fund Flows**
Vol-targeting funds mechanically reduce equity exposure when realized vol rises. A doubling of 20-day realized vol triggers ~$50-100B in equity selling.
*Source: Moreira & Muir (2017)*
→ **Action:** When 20-day realized vol doubles, expect mechanical selling. Size positions lighter and wait for vol normalization before adding.

**126. Month-End Pension Rebalancing**
Pension funds rebalance monthly to maintain target equity/bond allocation. After a month where equities gain >3%, pensions sell ~$10-20B in equities in the final 2 days.
*Source: State Street; Greenwood & Vayanos (2010)*
→ **Action:** After strong equity months, expect selling pressure on the last 2 trading days. Buy this dip on day 1 of the new month.

**127. Quarter-End Window Dressing**
Mutual funds buy recent winners and sell losers in the final week of each quarter to improve reported holdings. This creates ~0.5% upward pressure on recent winners.
*Source: Lakonishok, Shleifer, Thaler & Vishny (1991)*
→ **Action:** Buy recent top-performing sector ETFs in the last week of each quarter. Sell on day 2 of the new quarter.

**128. Index Rebalancing – S&P 500 Additions**
Stocks added to the S&P 500 average +3-5% excess returns from announcement to effective date (~5 trading days). The effect is permanent for ~1 year.
*Source: Shleifer (1986); Chen, Noronha & Singal (2004)*
→ **Action:** Buy S&P 500 additions at announcement. Hold through rebalance date. Consider selling 50% at rebalance, holding 50% for 6 months.

**129. Russell Reconstitution (June)**
Russell 2000 annual rebalancing in late June generates massive flows. Additions rally ~5% and deletions drop ~5% in the 2 weeks around reconstitution. Final day volume is 2-3× normal.
*Source: Russell/FTSE; Cai & Houge (2008)*
→ **Action:** Buy predicted Russell 2000 additions in early June. Short predicted deletions. Close positions on reconstitution day.

**130. MSCI Rebalancing (February, May, August, November)**
MSCI semi-annual rebalancing (May, November) and quarterly reviews create predictable flows in EM and international stocks. Additions see 2-4% excess returns.
*Source: MSCI; Chakrabarti, Huang, Jayaraman & Lee (2005)*
→ **Action:** Track MSCI rebalancing announcements. Buy additions, short deletions, hold through effective date.

**131. Triple Witching Pre-Positioning**
In the week before triple witching (third Friday of March, June, Sept, Dec), options market makers aggressively delta-hedge, creating ~0.3% daily range compression. The Friday itself sees vol expansion.
*Source: Stoll & Whaley (1991)*
→ **Action:** Sell premium (iron condors) Monday-Thursday of triple witch week. Close Thursday evening before Friday volatility.

**132. Monthly OpEx Gamma Unpin**
The Monday after monthly OpEx, open interest drops ~30%, reducing the gamma pin effect. The average absolute move on OpEx Monday is ~0.4% larger than normal Mondays.
*Source: Ni, Pearson & Poteshman (2005)*
→ **Action:** Expect larger-than-normal moves on OpEx Mondays. Enter directional trades on these days for better follow-through.

**133. VIX Expiration (Wednesday) Effect**
VIX settlement occurs Wednesday morning of expiration week. VIX futures converge to settlement, creating hedging flows that often spike intraday SPY volatility on that Wednesday AM.
*Source: CBOE VIX settlement methodology*
→ **Action:** Be aware of VIX expiration Wednesdays. Don't be surprised by pre-9:30 AM SPY moves driven by VIX settlement.

**134. Earnings Season Vol Selling – Sector Approach**
Selling strangles on sector ETFs during earnings season (when single-stock vol inflates but sector vol remains stable) yields positive returns ~70% of the time.
*Source: Doran & Krieger (2010)*
→ **Action:** During earnings season, sell strangles on XLK, XLF, XLV at 1 standard deviation. Sector vol overestimates realized vol by ~3 points.

**135. SPY Put Wall as Support**
The SPY strike with the largest put open interest acts as a "put wall" — a support level where dealer hedging creates buying pressure. It holds as support ~65% of the time.
*Source: SpotGamma; Bollen & Whaley (2004)*
→ **Action:** Identify the SPY put wall (highest put OI strike). Use it as a support level for entries. If broken, next major put strike becomes target.

**136. SPY Call Wall as Resistance**
The SPY strike with the largest call open interest acts as resistance. When SPY approaches from below, dealer hedging creates selling pressure.
*Source: SpotGamma*
→ **Action:** Identify the SPY call wall. Use as a resistance level for taking profits. If broken, expect acceleration higher.

**137. SPXW (Weekly SPX Options) Gamma Concentration**
Weekly SPX options concentrate gamma at round-number strikes (e.g., 5000, 5050, 5100). These levels act as magnets during the week of expiration.
*Source: CBOE weekly options data*
→ **Action:** Identify weekly SPX round-number strikes with highest OI. Use as intraday targets and reversal zones.

**138. Systematic Put Selling Strategies (e.g., PUTW)**
Systematic put-selling funds (~$50B AUM) sell puts at specific delta/DTE combinations. Their rolls create predictable flow patterns at monthly expiration.
*Source: CBOE Putwrite Index; Israelov & Nielsen (2015)*
→ **Action:** Be aware of put-selling fund roll dates (typically monthly OpEx). Their rolling creates brief price dislocations.

**139. Collar Fund Mechanics (e.g., JHEQX)**
JPM's Hedged Equity Fund (JHEQX, ~$20B) rolls quarterly collars on SPY at specific strikes. Their rolls create massive gamma at those strikes.
*Source: JPMorgan fund prospectus*
→ **Action:** Track JHEQX roll dates and strikes (quarterly near quarter-end). These strikes become massive support/resistance levels.

**140. Dispersion Trading Signal**
When implied correlation (from index vs. single-stock vols) is high (>0.75), selling index vol and buying single-stock vol (dispersion) is profitable ~65% of the time.
*Source: Driessen, Maenhout & Vilkov (2009)*
→ **Action:** High implied correlation = sell SPY straddles, buy single-stock straddles. Low correlation = reverse.

**141. Variance Risk Premium Harvesting**
The gap between implied and realized variance (VRP) averages ~4% annualized. Systematically selling 30-day variance (via short straddles) captures this premium.
*Source: Carr & Wu (2009); Bollerslev, Tauchen & Zhou (2009)*
→ **Action:** Sell 30-DTE ATM SPY straddles monthly, delta-hedge daily. Expect ~4% annualized excess return with ~15% annual vol.

**142. Term Structure of Equity Risk Premium**
Short-dated SPY puts (7-14 DTE) are overpriced by ~2× relative to long-dated (60-90 DTE). Selling short-dated and buying long-dated captures the slope.
*Source: Van Binsbergen & Koijen (2017)*
→ **Action:** Sell weekly SPY puts, buy monthly puts as a calendar spread. Capture the term premium difference.

**143. Momentum Factor Crash Risk**
When momentum factor (WML) drawdown exceeds 10% in a month, further losses of 5-10% typically follow as crowded momentum unwinds. The recovery takes 3-6 months.
*Source: Daniel & Moskowitz (2016)*
→ **Action:** Track momentum factor performance. >10% drawdown = exit momentum trades, switch to value.

**144. Short Interest as Squeeze Fuel**
Stocks with short interest >20% of float and days-to-cover >5 are squeeze candidates. When these stocks break above their 20-day MA, the average squeeze adds 15-30%.
*Source: Desai, Ramesh, Thiagarajan & Balachandran (2002)*
→ **Action:** Screen for high short interest + rising price. Enter on 20-day MA breakout with momentum confirmation.

**145. ETF Short Interest Anomaly**
When ETF short interest exceeds shares outstanding (through creation/lending chains), price discovery breaks down. HYG and IWM frequently show this, creating volatility spikes.
*Source: Evans, Ferreira, Prado (2017)*
→ **Action:** Monitor ETF short interest vs. shares outstanding. Extreme levels = expect volatility, widen stops.

**146. Buyback Blackout Period**
Corporate buybacks cease ~2 weeks before earnings (blackout). The S&P 500 loses its largest source of demand (~$5B/week). The blackout period shows 0.2% lower weekly returns.
*Source: Dittmar (2000); SEC Rule 10b-18*
→ **Action:** Reduce long exposure during blackout periods (2 weeks before earnings season peak). Add back when the window reopens.

**147. Buyback Announcement Effect**
Stocks announcing buybacks outperform by ~2% in the following month. The effect is stronger for value stocks and companies with declining share counts.
*Source: Ikenberry, Lakonishok & Vermaelen (1995)*
→ **Action:** Screen for fresh buyback announcements. Go long for 1-2 month holding period.

**148. IPO Lockup Expiration Selling**
IPO lockup expirations (typically 90-180 days post-IPO) create an average -2% return in the 5 days surrounding expiration due to insider selling.
*Source: Field & Hanka (2001); Bradley, Jordan, Yi & Roten (2001)*
→ **Action:** Short high-profile IPOs 3 days before lockup expiration. Cover 2 days after.

**149. FOMC Minutes vs. Statement Drift**
The FOMC minutes release (3 weeks after statement) shows a smaller but still significant +0.2% pre-release drift. The minutes reveal nuance that the statement masks.
*Source: Lucca & Moench (2015)*
→ **Action:** Go long SPY 2 hours before FOMC minutes release. Exit 30 minutes after release.

**150. End-of-Day MOC (Market-On-Close) Imbalance**
NYSE publishes MOC imbalances at 3:50 PM. Imbalances >$2B in one direction predict the final 10-minute move direction ~75% of the time.
*Source: NYSE; Cushing & Madhavan (2000)*
→ **Action:** Monitor the 3:50 PM MOC imbalance. >$2B buy imbalance = go long for the final 10 minutes. >$2B sell = go short.

## #151–200: Risk Management, Microstructure, Correlations & Geopolitical

**151. Kelly Criterion for Position Sizing**
Optimal bet size = (win rate × avg win – loss rate × avg loss) / avg win. For a 55% win rate with 1:1 payoff, Kelly says risk 10% of capital. Half-Kelly (5%) reduces drawdown while retaining ~75% of growth.
*Source: Kelly (1956); Thorp (2006)*
→ **Action:** Calculate Kelly for each strategy. Use half-Kelly as max position size. Never exceed full Kelly.

**152. 2% Rule – Per-Trade Risk Limit**
Never risk more than 2% of portfolio on a single trade. For a $25K portfolio, max loss per trade = $500. This ensures survival through 10+ consecutive losers.
*Source: Van Tharp (1998); Elder (1993)*
→ **Action:** Set hard 2% stop-losses on every position. Position size = $500 / (entry – stop distance).

**153. Portfolio Heat – Aggregate Risk Limit**
Total portfolio risk (sum of all position risks) should not exceed 6-10%. With a $25K portfolio, total risk at any time = max $2,500.
*Source: Van Tharp (1998)*
→ **Action:** Track aggregate portfolio risk daily. If approaching 10% ($2,500), close weakest positions before adding new ones.

**154. Volatility-Adjusted Position Sizing**
Size positions inversely proportional to their ATR (Average True Range). High-vol assets get smaller positions, low-vol assets get larger. This equalizes risk contribution.
*Source: Turtle Trading rules; Carver (2015)*
→ **Action:** Position size = (2% of portfolio) / (2 × 20-day ATR). Recalculate weekly.

**155. Maximum Drawdown Recovery Math**
A 10% drawdown requires 11% gain to recover. A 20% drawdown requires 25%. A 50% drawdown requires 100%. Prevention is far more efficient than recovery.
*Source: Basic arithmetic; Lo (2001)*
→ **Action:** Set a hard portfolio stop: if drawdown hits 10%, reduce all positions by 50% and reassess. At 15%, go to cash.

**156. Win Rate vs. Payoff Ratio Tradeoff**
A 40% win rate with 2:1 payoff ratio (expectancy = +0.2R) outperforms a 60% win rate with 0.8:1 payoff (expectancy = +0.08R). Maximize expectancy, not win rate.
*Source: Tharp (1998); Schwager (1989)*
→ **Action:** For each strategy, track both win rate and average win/loss ratio. Optimize for positive expectancy, not comfort.

**157. Correlation Regime Detection – Rolling 60-Day**
Rolling 60-day correlations between SPY and TLT shift from -0.3 (normal) to +0.5 (crisis) during macro shocks. When positive correlation emerges, traditional 60/40 diversification fails.
*Source: Campbell, Sunderam & Viceira (2017)*
→ **Action:** Track SPY-TLT 60-day rolling correlation. When it turns positive, add gold (GLD) and managed futures as alternative diversifiers.

**158. Equity-Bond Correlation Regime Shifts**
Pre-2000, stock-bond correlation was positive. Post-2000, it turned negative. In inflation regimes (>4% CPI), correlation turns positive again, destroying the diversification benefit.
*Source: Baele, Bekaert & Inghelbrecht (2010)*
→ **Action:** In inflationary regimes, replace TLT with TIPS (TIP), commodities (DBC), and gold (GLD) for diversification.

**159. Rolling Beta Adjustment**
Stock betas shift over time. Use 60-day rolling beta to adjust hedge ratios. When XLK beta to SPY rises above 1.3 (from normal 1.1), reduce XLK position or increase hedge.
*Source: Fama & French (1992)*
→ **Action:** Recalculate rolling betas weekly. Adjust position sizes and hedges when betas deviate >20% from historical norms.

**160. Intraday Correlation Spike as Crash Warning**
When intraday pairwise correlations among S&P 500 stocks spike above 0.8 (using 15-min returns), systemic liquidation is occurring. Normal is ~0.3.
*Source: Kritzman, Li, Page & Rigobon (2011), "Turbulence Index"*
→ **Action:** Monitor intraday correlation (or use Kritzman's turbulence measure). Spikes = reduce all positions immediately.

**161. Cross-Asset Momentum – 12-1 Month**
Going long assets with positive 12-month returns (excluding the most recent month) and short those with negative returns generates ~5-7% annualized alpha across equities, bonds, FX, and commodities.
*Source: Asness, Moskowitz & Pedersen (2013)*
→ **Action:** Monthly, rank SPY, TLT, GLD, DBC, EEM by 12-1 month return. Go long top 2, avoid bottom 2.

**162. Dual Momentum – Absolute + Relative**
Combine relative momentum (which asset is strongest) with absolute momentum (is the asset above its moving average). This avoids holding declining assets.
*Source: Antonacci (2014), "Dual Momentum"*
→ **Action:** Monthly: if SPY 12-month return >0 and SPY > IWM return, hold SPY. If both negative, hold TLT or cash.

**163. Mean-Variance Optimization – Practical Application**
Full MVO is unstable. Use the 1/N (equal weight) portfolio as a baseline—it outperforms MVO out-of-sample ~60% of the time due to estimation error.
*Source: DeMiguel, Garlappi & Uppal (2009)*
→ **Action:** Default to equal-risk-weighted positions. Only deviate when you have high-conviction signals.

**164. Maximum Diversification Ratio**
The diversification ratio (weighted average vol / portfolio vol) should be maximized. Track this metric to ensure you're getting true diversification, not just more positions.
*Source: Choueifaty & Coignard (2008)*
→ **Action:** Calculate diversification ratio weekly. If adding a position doesn't improve the ratio, skip it.

**165. Baltic Dry Index (BDI) as Global Growth Proxy**
The BDI leads global GDP by 2-3 months and has a 0.5 correlation with commodity stocks. A 30%+ decline signals global slowdown.
*Source: Bakshi, Panayotov & Skoulakis (2011)*
→ **Action:** Track BDI weekly. Rapid decline = underweight commodities (XLB, XLE) and EM (EEM). Recovery = overweight.

**166. Copper as Dr. Copper – Economic Diagnosis**
Copper prices lead industrial production by 3 months. A 15%+ decline from peak signals manufacturing recession.
*Source: Labys & Maizels (1993); Bloomberg*
→ **Action:** Track copper futures. Breakdown = underweight XLI, XLB. Breakout = overweight.

**167. Dow Theory – Transportation Index Confirmation**
When DJIA makes a new high but the Dow Transports (IYT) does not confirm, it's a classic bearish divergence. Non-confirmation preceded 2007 and 2020 tops.
*Source: Rhea (1932); Brown, Goetzmann & Kumar (1998)*
→ **Action:** Track SPY vs. IYT. If SPY makes a new high without IYT confirmation, tighten stops and add hedges.

**168. Semiconductor Index (SOX) as Leading Indicator**
The SOX leads SPY by 1-3 months at cycle turns. Semis are early-cycle and reflect both tech capex and auto/industrial demand.
*Source: Market observation; technology capex literature*
→ **Action:** Track SMH (semi ETF) vs. SPY. SMH breakdown before SPY = early warning. SMH breakout = confirmation of uptrend.

**169. Retail Sales Surprise vs. XRT**
XRT (retail ETF) moves 0.5-1% on retail sales day based on the surprise magnitude. XRT positions before the release capture a directional edge if you've modeled the data.
*Source: Census Bureau; internal analysis*
→ **Action:** Use credit card spending data (available from banks, restaurants, airlines) to estimate retail sales direction pre-release.

**170. High-Frequency Data – Airline TSA Throughput**
TSA throughput data (daily, with 1-day lag) predicts airline revenue and consumer travel spending. A sustained >5% YoY increase is bullish for JETS ETF.
*Source: TSA.gov*
→ **Action:** Track weekly TSA throughput. Acceleration = long JETS. Deceleration = reduce consumer discretionary.

**171. Credit Card Spending Data (Real-Time)**
Weekly credit/debit card spending data (from BAC, JPM, Visa reports) provides real-time consumer health signals 3-4 weeks before official retail sales.
*Source: Bank of America Consumer Checkpoint; JP Morgan Chase Institute*
→ **Action:** Monitor weekly card spending trackers. Deceleration = underweight XLY, XRT. Acceleration = overweight.

**172. Behavioral Bias – Disposition Effect (Holding Losers)**
Investors hold losers 1.5× longer than winners. This creates predictable selling pressure when losers finally reach breakeven.
*Source: Shefrin & Statman (1985); Odean (1998)*
→ **Action:** After a recovery rally, expect selling at previous high-volume price levels (breakeven for trapped longs). Use these as resistance.

**173. Behavioral Bias – Anchoring to Round Numbers**
Significant portions of limit orders cluster at round numbers (e.g., SPY 500, 550, 600). These levels act as support/resistance purely from order flow.
*Source: Kuo, Lin & Zhao (2015); Bhattacharya, Holden & Jacobsen (2012)*
→ **Action:** Use round-number SPY levels as reference points for entries and exits. Place stops slightly beyond them.

**174. Behavioral Bias – Recency Bias Exploitation**
After 3+ consecutive up days, retail sentiment becomes excessively bullish. After 3+ down days, excessively bearish. The contrarian edge is ~0.3% daily.
*Source: De Bondt & Thaler (1985); Barberis, Shleifer & Vishny (1998)*
→ **Action:** After 3+ consecutive days in one direction, look for reversal setups. Small position, tight stop.

**175. Behavioral Bias – Loss Aversion at -10% from Highs**
Retail investors panic-sell at -10% drawdowns from portfolio highs. This creates predictable washout patterns at 10% corrections in SPY.
*Source: Kahneman & Tversky (1979); Benartzi & Thaler (1995)*
→ **Action:** At -10% SPY corrections, look for capitulation volume (2×+ average) as a buy signal.

**176. Behavioral Bias – Herding in Options Markets**
When retail call buying (measured by small lot <10 contracts) spikes to extremes, the market is near a short-term top ~60% of the time.
*Source: Han (2008); Lemmon & Ni (2014)*
→ **Action:** Track retail options sentiment. Extreme call buying = trim longs. Extreme put buying = buy dips.

**177. Tax-Loss Selling (December) and January Bounce**
Stocks down >20% YTD face additional selling pressure in November-December from tax-loss harvesting. These same stocks rebound 3-5% in January.
*Source: Poterba & Weisbenner (2001); Grinblatt & Keloharju (2004)*
→ **Action:** In early January, buy a basket of stocks that dropped >20% the prior year. Hold through January.

**178. Window Dressing – Quarterly Performance Chasing**
Mutual funds buy recent winners in the final 5 days of each quarter. The top-decile performing stocks average +0.4% excess return in these days.
*Source: Lakonishok, Shleifer, Thaler & Vishny (1991)*
→ **Action:** Buy top-performing sector ETF in the final week of each quarter. Sell day 2 of new quarter.

**179. Calendar Anomaly – Pre-Holiday Drift**
The trading day before US market holidays (Memorial Day, July 4, Labor Day, etc.) averages +0.2% with win rate ~65%. Lower volume and positive sentiment drive the drift.
*Source: Ariel (1990); Pettengill (1989)*
→ **Action:** Go long SPY the day before major US holidays. Close at the open of the next trading day.

**180. Calendar Anomaly – First Day of Month**
The first trading day of each month averages +0.1% with ~57% win rate, likely driven by automated savings flows (401k, pension contributions).
*Source: Lakonishok & Smidt (1988)*
→ **Action:** Go long SPY at the prior day's close, exit on day 1 close. Simple, small edge, high frequency.

**181. Calendar Anomaly – End of Quarter Inflows**
401(k) quarterly statements trigger rebalancing flows. The first week of each quarter sees ~$5B+ in equity inflows from retirement accounts.
*Source: ICI Flow of Funds*
→ **Action:** Go long SPY on the last day of each quarter through day 5 of the new quarter.

**182. Geopolitical Event Playbook – Military Conflict**
Markets sell off 5-10% on the onset of major military conflicts but recover to pre-event levels within 1-3 months ~80% of the time ("buy the invasion").
*Source: Schneider & Troeger (2006); Rigobon & Sack (2005)*
→ **Action:** During military conflict selloffs, start buying in 3 tranches over 2 weeks. History says the bounce comes.

**183. Geopolitical – Sanctions/Trade War Positioning**
New sanctions on major economies (Russia, China) create 1-3 month disruptions. Commodity prices spike, then normalize. The best trade is buying the dip in affected sector ETFs.
*Source: Hufbauer, Schott & Elliott (2009)*
→ **Action:** Sanctions on oil exporters = buy XLE on the spike, sell after 1 month. Sanctions on tech = buy SMH dips after initial shock.

**184. Tariff Announcement Effects**
Tariff announcements create immediate sector moves: tariffs on China = sell EEM, buy XLP/XLU. The first move is usually an overreaction that partially reverses within 2 weeks.
*Source: Fajgelbaum, Goldberg, Kennedy & Khandelwal (2020)*
→ **Action:** Fade tariff overreactions after 2-3 days. The initial move is -1.5% on SPY on average, recovering 50% within 10 days.

**185. Election Cycle – Q4 of Election Year**
Q4 of election years (Oct-Dec) averages +4% for SPY as uncertainty resolves regardless of winner. The VIX compression post-election adds ~2% alone.
*Source: Hirsch; Julio & Yook (2012)*
→ **Action:** Go long SPY in October of election years. The uncertainty premium unwind is the trade, not the winner.

**186. Election Cycle – Midterm Q4 Rally**
Q4 of midterm years has been positive 100% of the time since 1942 (18/18). Average return: +8.2%. This is the single most reliable seasonal pattern in US equities.
*Source: Hirsch, Stock Trader's Almanac*
→ **Action:** Go aggressively long SPY in October of midterm years. This is a near-certainty historically.

**187. Government Shutdown Risk**
Government shutdowns create 1-3% SPY dips that fully recover within 2 weeks of resolution. The market barely cares about shutdowns longer than 1 week.
*Source: Historical data, 2013, 2018-19 shutdowns*
→ **Action:** Buy SPY dips on shutdown headlines. The resolution always comes and the market recovers.

**188. Debt Ceiling Playbook**
Debt ceiling crises create predictable VIX spikes (to 25-35) and T-bill yield inversions. Resolution sends VIX crashing and equities rallying 3-5%.
*Source: 2011, 2013, 2023 debt ceiling episodes*
→ **Action:** During debt ceiling standoffs, sell VIX call spreads and buy SPY call spreads. Resolution is virtually guaranteed.

**189. Natural Disaster Trading**
Category 4-5 hurricanes hitting major US metro areas cause 1-2 day SPY dips of 0.5-1%, then recovery. Insurance stocks (KIE) drop 5-10% and recover over 3 months.
*Source: Worthington & Valadkhani (2004)*
→ **Action:** Don't panic sell on natural disaster headlines. Buy KIE dips if major hurricane strikes—claims are already priced.

**190. Alternative Data – Satellite Parking Lot Counts**
Satellite imagery counting parking lot occupancy at retailers (Walmart, Target, Costco) predicts quarterly revenue with 0.7 correlation, 2-3 weeks before earnings.
*Source: Katona, Painter, Patatoukas & Zeng (2018)*
→ **Action:** Subscribe to or track satellite data services. Above-trend parking = long retailer pre-earnings.

**191. Copper/Gold Ratio as 10Y Yield Predictor**
The copper/gold ratio has a 0.8 correlation with the 10Y Treasury yield. When the ratio diverges from the 10Y by >2 standard deviations, the yield adjusts.
*Source: Gundlach, DoubleLine; Rosenberg (various)*
→ **Action:** If copper/gold is falling but 10Y yields are stable, expect yields to drop → long TLT. If rising while yields are stable, expect yields to rise → short TLT.

**192. TIPS Breakeven as Inflation Expectations**
5Y TIPS breakevens are the market's best real-time inflation forecast. When breakevens rise >50bps in a month, the Fed response follows within 2 meetings.
*Source: Gürkaynak, Sack & Wright (2010)*
→ **Action:** Track 5Y breakevens. Rapid rise = expect hawkish Fed. Position for rates up (short TLT, long XLF).

**193. TED Spread (T-bill vs. Eurodollar/SOFR) as Stress Gauge**
When the TED spread (or its SOFR equivalent) exceeds 50bps, interbank lending stress is emerging. Above 100bps preceded 2008 and March 2020.
*Source: Brunnermeier (2009)*
→ **Action:** Monitor TED/SOFR spread. Above 50bps = reduce exposure. Above 100bps = go maximum defensive.

**194. Overnight Funding Stress (SOFR Spikes)**
When SOFR spikes >25bps above the target range (as in Sept 2019 repo crisis), liquidity stress is acute. Equities typically drop 1-2% within a week.
*Source: Copeland, Duffie & Yang (2021)*
→ **Action:** Monitor daily SOFR. Spike = expect equity weakness. Fed intervention usually follows, creating a buy signal.

**195. FRA-OIS Spread as Banking Stress**
The FRA-OIS spread measures bank credit risk perception. Above 40bps signals elevated interbank stress and precedes equity volatility ~70% of the time.
*Source: Schwartz (2019)*
→ **Action:** FRA-OIS >40bps = add portfolio hedges. This spread spiked before SVB failure in 2023.

**196. Cross-Currency Basis Swap as Dollar Demand Proxy**
When EUR/USD cross-currency basis widens beyond -30bps, it signals excessive global dollar demand (stress). This preceded every major risk-off event since 2008.
*Source: Borio, McCauley, McGuire & Sushko (2016)*
→ **Action:** Monitor cross-currency basis swaps. Widening beyond -30bps = go defensive, expect dollar strength.

**197. Market Microstructure – Bid-Ask Spread Widening**
When SPY bid-ask spreads widen >2× normal (from ~$0.01 to >$0.02), it signals market maker de-risking. This precedes volatility spikes by hours to days.
*Source: Hendershott & Moulton (2011); Chordia, Roll & Subrahmanyam (2001)*
→ **Action:** Monitor Level 2 spread data. Widening = reduce position sizes and tighten stops.

**198. Dark Pool Activity as Institutional Signal**
When dark pool short volume exceeds 55% of total dark pool volume (vs. normal ~45%), it signals institutional selling that precedes next-day weakness ~60% of the time.
*Source: FINRA ATS data; Comerton-Forde & Putniņš (2015)*
→ **Action:** Monitor FINRA dark pool data (2-day lag). Elevated short volume = expect near-term weakness.

**199. Odd-Lot Trades as Retail Sentiment Proxy**
Rising odd-lot buying (<100 shares) as a percentage of total trades signals increasing retail participation. Extreme levels mark sentiment peaks.
*Source: Barber, Huang, Odean & Schwarz (2022)*
→ **Action:** Track odd-lot ratios. Extreme highs = contrarian sell signal. Low levels after selloffs = retail has capitulated (buy).

**200. Closing Auction Imbalance Persistence**
When MOC imbalances trend in the same direction for 3+ consecutive days, a short-term trend is established. The imbalance persistence predicts next-day open direction ~58% of the time.
*Source: NYSE; Bogousslavsky (2021)*
→ **Action:** Track daily MOC imbalance direction. 3+ days same direction = go with the trend at next day's open. Small position, tight stop.
