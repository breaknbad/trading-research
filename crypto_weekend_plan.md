# Weekend Crypto Battle Plan — Alfred (RISK)
## Session: Fri Feb 27 8PM ET → Sun Mar 1 8PM ET

## Market Context
- BTC ~$65-67K, down 2% on 24h. Dropped from $70K bounce Wed to $65K.
- ETH, SOL, XRP all down 2-3%. Broad risk-off.
- Hot PPI data fueling sell-off. $260M liquidations.
- SOL down 32% on the month. Brutal.
- AI-linked tokens and Decred bucking the bearish trend.
- BNB slightly green (+0.67%).

## Thesis: Bearish bias with selective longs on relative strength
- Macro is risk-off. Don't fight it.
- Short the weakest (SOL down 32% monthly — momentum is crushing it)
- Long relative strength plays (AI tokens, BNB)
- Weekend liquidity is thin — big moves possible both ways

## Opening Positions (deploy at 8 PM ET)
Target: 50%+ in predictions per rules

### Shorts (bearish thesis):
- SOL — weakest major, -32% monthly, no bottom in sight
- ETH — dragging with BTC, no catalyst

### Longs (relative strength):
- BNB — only green major on the day
- AI tokens (research specific tickers) — bucking trend

### Hedge:
- BTC small long if it holds $65K support — dead cat bounce play for weekend

## 3-Hour Predictions Format
Every 3 hours: current positions + thesis + next moves + biggest risk
5 min after window: share position details

## Notes
- No risk rules = can go concentrated
- 50% must be in prediction positions
- Thin weekend liquidity = wider spreads, more volatile
- Watch for weekend liquidation cascades
